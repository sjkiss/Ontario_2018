2,Comfortable,Positive
3,,
4,I feel stressed about not being able to find a job,I don't have an issue with it
5,Could be better but living comfortably,I am neutral
6,I get by but there are no extras,There should be more guidelines but allowances should be made
7,Comfortable,Comfortable
8,Not very good and not getting any better.,It must be equated to available jobs.
9,,
10,,
11,Has been better and could be worse.,Immigrants should not come to Canada expecting a free ride/life but with tools/ideas of their contribution to the country.
12,It could always get better,Everyone deserves a safe home
13,Struggling to see improvement,"I think that it is needed, but there needs to be stricter guidelines"
14,I think that Kathleen is doing a horrible job.,I think letting people in Canada like that is a bad idea
15,After studying I didn't find a better job,
16,"very poor, hardly meet my financial needs relying on the GIS",should support the immigration of the parents of the immigrants
17,Stay the same but going to get worst,watch out for former ISIS
18,Not bad,
19,Unsatisfied.  I make good money but because taxes and hydro are so expensive I feel like I will never not live pay check to pay check,Too much is happening
20,Stressed,Unfavourable
21,It could definitely be better as I am not financially secure and it completely stresses me out.,"I have no real problem with immigrants as it helps create diversity and welcomes all people to Canada, the country I love and am both grateful and privileged to be  born in. I just slightly fear things like terrorism or illegal activity, drug/human trafficking."
22,If only,Good
23,Quite content.,"When following procedures for entry, it is okay."
24,Fine,It's necessary
25,"I am on O.D.S.P. haha, disability support program, they don't think we need phones, TV, computers, full fridges, bills paid, we live cheque to cheque.","If they are fleeing then it is okay. Immigration takes a lot of work to get here and they apparently need to be able to work, if they are allowed to go onto the welfare system they should not get more than we already get ourselves."
26,I am senior living in RGI housing and that makes my financial situation liveable. But I cannot afford badly needed dental work.,We all benefit from immigration. We need new people to grow the economy. I live living in a country that is open to immigrants and refugees.
27,They are OK.,As in all things there should be a balance.
28,,
29,Fine,It keeps our population growing
30,Getting by with not much left over,Everyone should be welcome
31,Comfortable,I feel it's necessary
32,in more debt than I ever been in my life,they live better than me
33,"Living comfortably, able to put some money into savings at the end of the month.","We do not need, nor can we afford refugees. Instead, immigration should concentrate on high level skills in trades, STEM, medical and health professionals. We already have enough people in the country who desperately need help. Once there is no poverty in Canada, THEN we can entertain bringing in a small number of refugees, WILLING TO FULLY INTEGRATE!"
34,Fine,Canada is a cultural mosaic and each new point of view makes it culturally richer
35,I manage to get by,they should be forced to learn English
36,needs improvement - cost of living/food etc. increase but incomes not enough if at all to cover rising costs,"Immigrants should have to follow all the rules that Canadians have to & not have special treatment; they should not be given healthcare, roof over their heads etc. at the expense of the Canadian taxpayers. They need to work, speak & pay just like the rest of us"
37,not very good,There are far too many immigrants coming in - especially freeloaders and criminals
38,I live on ccp survivor  pension  it's not much  but it helps,I think if you are able to work and want to work that's fine by me
39,I am unhappy with my personal financial situation.,Immigration should be open to people to come to Canada and positively contribute to the country.  It should not place a burden on social assistance and welfare.
40,good,
41,needs to improve or we will not be able to keep up with expenses.  income does not go up but so much else does!,"they must abide by Canadian rules, policies, laws and not expect to come here and request changes to suit them.  IF they come they remember they are now in a new country which has welcomed them and not start raising problems"
42,,
43,Little worried the living cost is high,Increasing and development is more
44,,
45,It will get better because of job security,"There is too much. We are diluting our society. We need to focus on helping Canada and less on others. Immigration is fine, but this too much. There are many things in Canada we need to fix first"
46,dismal,it's way too high and causes a housing shortage and bubble
47,,
48,,
49,unstable,way too many and the government shouldn't be doing more for them it should be just as much as they do for people born here
50,safe and reasonable debt,it contributes to Canadian economy
51,I am scared,
52,quite tough increase cost of living,neutral
53,,
54,Little tight,Too much immigrants
55,Doing okay,It is the single worst thing
56,things are very tight right now and we are living pay check to pay check but managing. No money for any extras only bills and groceries.,I have mixed feelings. everyone deserves a safe place to live and there are lots of people who need a fresh start. sometimes it's hard when you hear stories about clashing cultures and what has happened in other countries from letting refugees in
57,,
58,,
59,Stressed,It's helpful
60,It is ok but could be better. Hoping for better soon.,Positive step in the past and critical in the presence.
61,Comfortable,
62,Could be better,Good for country
63,,
64,"Stable for now, but a job change will be necessary in the near future",Immigration is a good thing. Immigrants face a lot of obstacles already. People should be able to choose where they live.
65,,
66,Not preferable.,I'm glad to have different races in our country.
67,Taxes are too high,Is a federal issue
68,living on  a low income,too many refugees are coming through our borders.
69,good better without trump worse if doug ford elected scary,good overall
70,,
71,,
72,,
73,"my financial situation is OK, I am making ends meet",a bit unsure of this
74,The PCs will destroy Ontario but not as quickly as the other parties,PCs are going to ruin Ontario and are a party that doesn't care about the people
75,bad,good
76,I feel comfortable,Helps the economy and population
77,,
78,,
79,"Horrible. I have enough to live comfortably (although without a car) but yet I have no savings and 22,000 in debt for mostly wants and uncovered medical expenses - like supplements and advanced testing (like pharmacogenetic testing). I feel like the idea of home ownership is far in the future. And my boyfriend only earns minimum wage while I am the main bread winner.",Well Canada is a country made up almost entirely of immigrants so it would be hypocritical to not support immigration to Canada.
80,Hopeless,They should go back to the way we used to have immigration with sponsored people because just coming here and living off the system only  creates resentment
81,Stable,Would like to see better screening
82,Doing well but could have more,It is a wonderful thing
83,,
84,Ok,Ok
85,,
86,,
87,,
88,,
89,,
90,,
91,Living paycheck to paycheck,I think  closer eye has to be kept on who and how many people being let in.
92,"Stressed. Can't afford to pay down debts, save, and live.","As long as vetting systems are in place, I have no issue with it."
93,We are a one income family that is over taxed because we choose to raise our own children,It's too much too quickly.
94,Stable as it can be,Needs to be closely monitored
95,Bad,
96,I feel that I will never get ahead because of the cost of living particularly because of housing costs.,Because Canada is a large country and fairly unpopulated in large areas and the declining birthrate more immigrants should be brought in and made to settle in the underpopulated areas.
97,Very bad. Going back to school for second career to hopefully improve it,"While I agree with immigration, priority should be spent on our citizens first and foremost"
98,I feel very comfortable in the place I'm in life could not be any easier,I feel that it is not fair that they get so much money
99,,
100,I don't know,its good
101,We are currently OK.,I am an Immigrant
102,"I am living comfortably, my family provides me with the money I need as I am a student","While it is good to help out, I do believe that Canada should put a lower cap on the number of refugees it lets into the country"
103,Stressed.  Lost job of 20 years and new job pay is much less.  Liberals also took away transit tax credit which was a big help as transit costs me $22/day.,"Canada is too liberal with immigration.  They come here, get free health care, a place to live, money, a free education and free ESL classes.  Then, (a lot of them) go back to their birth country and live for 6 months.  All at tax payers expense.  They should receive these services only if they are citizens and should not be allowed to hold dual citizenship.  If you say anything then you are discriminating against them."
104,No,No
105,Bad not good,Mostly bad
106,Not great,I feel positively about it
107,,
108,I work for an online company based in the US because I can't find work on Ontario after I finished University so I'm doing okay but Ontario sucks to find jobs in.,Immigration to Canada is hard and most people don't realize how the process works and how many people wait years to get in. I'm fine with the way it is now.
109,Okay,Good
110,,
111,We are doing ok,Canada is doing a good job
112,Good I guess.,It's is a good thing
113,perfect and great,Don't think it's a good thing if many of them are coming over
114,Bad no future,Too many newcomers abuse system
115,Pretty stable,Good
116,It's not comfortable. We're getting squeezed from every side.,It's a good thing.
117,Just ok but not fine,Good way to increase
118,Pretty good,Not so bad
119,My financial situation is just okay. I find that's it's hard to save up money by doing only one job. Toronto is an expensive place to live,It helps Canadian economy
120,Terrible,"Helping immigrants is fine, but what about us Canadians living on very low incomes.  We need help too."
121,Good,It is very good for the country
122,,a much better living environment and standard.
123,"It's very difficult to pay for everyday needs. I'm not talking about wants. I'm talking about gas, food, hydro. It's all gotten way too expensive. I'm shopping clearance produce & meat at the cheap grocery stores & it's still too expensive. Something has to change!",It's a horrible shame that people are crossing into our country illegally from open borders in Quebec & then taxpayers have to put them up in shelters & hotels paying for them!!!!
124,,
125,I'm still developing,It's good
126,Pretty bad,It's ok
127,Comfortable for now but I'm worried by increased bills and taxes,"Immigration is good for the growth of Canada, they aren't taking our jobs"
128,"Minimizing and educating myself and my family about frugality and want VS need had greatly increased our happiness, financial stability, and lessened our impact on the world and its resources. The majority of Canadians live better right now than the royalty of every previous generation that has existed in this planet.",We are all ONE people. Borders are a mental construct and result from prehistoric viral memes which need to be eradicated through education.
129,Could be better,It's a good thing
130,It's fine just a few ups and downs,They should make it more strict
131,,
132,Total crap,We seem to care more about fishing licenses than illegal immigrants from all over the world. Especially USA
133,,
134,It's ok but can be stressful,I like it
135,I feel content since I have a stable source of income.,"I feel that immigration, which has security checks helps all of Canada"
136,,
137,I'm making it,It should change
138,Not,Need to be careful
139,Needs to be better,"Happy we have such diverse culture but, we loose our own culture in the mix"
140,I deserve to make more,Open to helping other people but we shouldn't forget the people of Canada
141,"I feel ok now, but am concerned about the future if the Ontario government does not balance the budget and  does not reduce taxes.",I have no problem with immigrants as long as they go through the standard procedure to make sure they are safe and will contribute to society
142,Hoping to have enough to for retiring and live comfortably,Most immigrants take jobs that Canadians will not take as too degrading or too much work for low wages.
143,Feel fairly the same however extremely concerned if the Libs are re-elected or the NDP winning the election,Need to allow real immigrants into Canada....the individuals that have properly applied and gone through the system in the normal application .
144,not worried but could be better,okay in most respects as long as they are not leaching the system.
145,I am doing OK. I am retired and I also have my husband still working.,I feel that there should be stronger policies in place with more restrictions about who should be allowed to immigrate to Canada and also who is truly a refugee. More time should be spent looking into backgrounds and  claims of these people who want to immigrate to here.
146,Worse,Better
147,Comfortable,Supportive
148,Living comfortably,"Neutral, I don't know any statistics"
149,Just about coping and managing. Would like to have a bit more income to enjoy life.,The genuine legal applications are not being processed but the fast tracked refugees are pouring in!  Seems very unfair and the sponsored legal spouses and families are broken for years on end!
150,making it,stricter laws needed
151,it sucks,neither agree or disagree
152,Comfortable,Could be better
153,I live comfortably below my means,Canada is a nation of past and current immigrants
154,I wish I had a more stable income,"I think immigrants are an asset to Canada. People who don't like immigrants fail to realize that these are the same people that do the jobs that white Canadians don't want to do. So when these white Canadians complain about immigrants taking jobs, I am beyond frustrated because they won't apply for those jobs in the first place so immigrants are not actually stealing them."
155,"It could be better.  With everything going up in prices, the government does not increase my pension.","Anyone who immigrates to Canada MUST speak either English or French and accept Canadian customs.  They want to leave their country and start in a new one, then change.  If they do not want to change, go back to where they came from."
156,Very good. On government pension as well as CPP and OAS.,all for it as that is what I was
157,"I am living comfortably, and feel positive about my future",it should be encouraged
158,Ok,Support it
159,Rough but manageable,It's important!
160,"I have enough to pay all the bills, as well as other luxuries","It helps shape our country, and creates diversity. We get to learn about other cultures"
161,Could be better,I'm fine with it
162,,
163,,
164,,
165,I wish I had a more income,I think it's wonderful that people can come over and help benefit and create benefits for the economy.
166,,
167,,
168,I'm broke but getting by,
169,I am struggling.,I'm okay with it.
170,Optimistic,Accepting
171,,
172,Getting desperate,If you encourage immigration do not require Canadian experience. And make sure process is followed
173,Got worse,Ok
174,It's pretty tight with expenses being so expensive,I feel like it is too much. We have our own people to take care of first instead of these newcomers
175,Harder to save money than previous years,Could strength our boarders a little bit but overall it is good.
176,"I feel like I am 1 paycheck away from being homeless, too much money is being given out for child tax credit",They spend more money on immigrants than our own people.
177,,
178,no comment,no comment
179,could always use a raise,everyone deserves a chance to live freely
180,Wish I was making more money,keep helping refugees
181,Good,Need more waps
182,,
183,,
184,,
185,,
186,"Thankful that I qualified for cppd, but wish it was at a higher rate.","Doing a good job.

Hoping they are screening people with criminal records."
187,Bleak,It needs to stop
188,it is doing pretty well,I love how it is now
189,Bleak. Hopeless. Hard to manage.,Relatively indifferent. Happy that people have a friendly place to go.
190,,
191,"I am retired and my husband has no income as he was on ODSP and when I retired they cut his benefits. So we live on my OAS, GIS, CPP & a small annuity. Makes it difficult at times to get by.",I feel that we are letting too many illegal immigrants into this country. People who are trying to legally enter Canada have a hard time.
192,I am scraping by,I believe we should have less
193,,
194,I am a great saver and investor,helps Canada become more multicultural
195,It is bad due to other circumstances like divorce.,Canada takes in too many immigrants for the economy to support. It is becoming a burden to normal tax payers.
196,"Living paycheque to paycheque. Trying to make ends meet every month. I think the government should make a policy about all insurance, that we get at least 50% of what we paid for every year if we do not make any claims.. Our insurance system here in Canada is like a government-backed scam. We pay every month to make someone else rich. And if try and make a claim, we have to deal with DEDUCTIBLES.. it's hard enough that we earn minimum wage, yet we pay more if not the same with the rich. No offense to them but, I don't think they know what it's like to live paycheque to paycheque ..","Biased. We have immigrants who have issues or problems with their documents but officials don't offer any solution but deportation. I understand sometimes there are some MISREPRESENTATION of what is true supposedly in immigrant papers but the government 's only answer is deportation. I haven't heard of any programs to help or somehow correct what's wrong in immigrant's documents. Immigrants, including myself, work hard and gets taxed to the maximum by the government. Shouldn't we somehow get some help from the government regarding our documents without ever having to face deportation? There are so many others out there who's done so many bad things or crimes yet, they didn't get deported but are entitled to lawyers who defend them in court. They have lots of money I suppose. But I think we deserve some help from the government too, so we all could come forward and not hide and be proud that we're Canadians or permanent residents being helped by OUR government. And not only the refugees"
197,"Had a client pass away last December, so my financial income was slashed by 3/4. Had to go on Social Assistance to help out till I'm old enough to get my pension.",The universe has always been based on immigration. That means diversity. I'm for diversity.
198,My personal financial situation remains the same,Immigration is important to Canada
199,could be better,too much
200,It is currently stable but health care costs will increase significantly as I grow older.,We need immigration in order to grow as a nation. But we need the right checks and balances in place to avoid overcrowding large urban centres.
201,I'm on a tight budget and small changes in bills really affect me.,"I think immigration is a great thing! It's part of our Canadian identity. However if you immigrate to Canada, you should conform to our values of equality and women's rights."
202,I work two pat time jobs to make ends meet.,They should have to follow the same rules as us without having to impose laws to benefit their own culture
203,will survive,too many Asians
204,,
205,Feel ok about it but we made the decision to be a one income family and have one person stay home with our children.,I generally agree with it but there needs to be clear limits.
206,Not very stable,Too many immigrants
207,My finances are fine but always be better,Could handle a little better
208,,
209,Luckily I have a very good job and can afford to pay my bills and live,Immigration the way it used to be when our forefathers immigrated is the proper way it should be done and enforced. Line jumpers and criminals need to be sent back immediately regardless of the consequences they face in their own country
210,"Not great, and it's a cause for stress.","I don't really know -- haven't really thought about it. I do know it doesn't really bother me, though I do have concerns about the job situation, because there are already thousands of Canadian citizens that need jobs, and it's worsened by companies adding to it by hiring off-shore instead of in-country."
211,"It isn't improving,  so over time I am going to fall further and further behind...and will eventually be screwed.","Not really an issue.   Those that complain are threatened.  how  are they threatened? are they unemployed, feel unsafe, etc.  Those are the issues, the immigrants look like an easy excuse rather than getting help for the real problem."
212,Getting by but could be better.,Necessary
213,Fine,Got personally screwed over by immigration Canada immigrating my spouse from USA. Come from anywhere but north America and it's all handed to you. Come from North America and it's nothing but a struggle
214,Just in between jobs at the moment,The government does more for immigrants and refugees than they do for indigenous communities which isn't fair one damn bit
215,Great,Great I am satisfied I think they bring a lot of great talent
216,I have to bust my hump to support my family. The struggle is real,"Not to sound rude but the white people have become the minority. I was born in Niagara, raised to believe in equality and was proud to be part of a diverse community, but some years later I'm beginning to feel out of place and made to feel u comfortable celebrating my own traditions and beliefs. My family's accepting of everyone's beliefs but it doesn't seem the same in return. When Canadian traditions begin disappearing from schools and most public places, everything Canada has stood for begins to crumble. What people came to Canada to be a part of is taken away little by little until what foundation is left?"
217,"As a small business owner, stressed",If they come here to work and make something of themselves then fine. But if they are here just for the handouts. Get out!
218,No comment,No comment
219,I feel disappointed in finding a good career.,It's okay we just also have to care about Canadians that were born here.
220,Same as last year,If is good
221,,
222,I don't like it.,"Immigration is a good thing, except when we pay to house those who cross the border illegally."
223,,
224,,
225,"Could always be better, but can't complain... yet.",You want to live here... follow our rules.
226,That's is subject this doc eek loves jerk jack of,Inch DC week is well ox cut this eh obfuscated
227,I'm coping but would like to be more financially comfortable,Immigration is positive for Canada
228,I'm struggling a bit after a few month without employment but I am slowly getting back on track.,I think we are not careful enough about who we allow into the country.  We need to stop reintegrating terrorists and start looking for the best of the people looking to immigrate.
229,"My income is ok, it's the cost of rent and how can I pay 15000 a year in rent and save for a house. It's a joke. Will never happen. Rent is more then 30% of most incomes.",I think it takes away from the people here. I'm on a wait list for housing but yet new to Canada took priority over me who's been waiting 8 years
230,,
231,I'm getting by but it would help if I got taxed less or thing cost less,
232,Stable,Good for the country
233,,
234,taxed to death,send them home
235,Precarious tax a lot need more help,I think we need to take care of our own first and foremost
236,I feel like minimum wage could be higher,I feel like Canada is the best place to be for immigrants there's a lot to offer here immigration has improve a lot
237,Working too hard for and seeing very little  benefit,"If handled with due diligence, it can be a positive thing."
238,Just getting by,"Immigration to Canada is good, they help the immigrants very well but I hope they don't abuse it."
239,I feel like the jobs that are available to me in my area don't match up with the cost or living or give me the possibility of being truly independent from others,Immigration is fine as long as those who come here are qualified and are able to stand on their own two feet and not abuse any government assistant and robbing that access to those who truly need it.
240,,
241,AM SATISFIED WITH STAYING WITHIN BUDGET,MORE VETTING NEEDS TO BE DONE FIRST
242,,
243,bad,ok
244,it is ok,it is ok
245,recently unemployed with no prospects,we need it but let bring in skills we need
246,Very bad,Not bad
247,retired and getting a monthly pension,Opportunities exists for everyone
248,Getting along,Ok
249,Terrible ...the govt takes and gives to all the refugees,It's terrible
250,Good,Good
251,getting by day by day,open and inclusive
252,I'd be fine if I wasn't paying so much in taxes to support useless government initiatives.,"Immigration is what the country was built on.  But people should have to go through strict protocols and not just be allowed into Canada just because.



They should also not be allowed to locate in major cities that already are taxed in terms of infrastructure."
253,concerned,it is great if managed well
254,its really good,"I absolutely hate it, it needs to be reformed asap or Canadian culture and its people will cease to exist"
255,I could do better,Let  proper  immigrants  move  here
256,somewhat comfortable,"somewhat positive, there is always a few that are not representative of the majority that give an unfair image of the group"
257,,
258,growing worse,good for all
259,coping,too many for the sake of votes
260,Just getting by,Don't know
261,"Will worsen as each year passes because living expenses overall are to high. using retirement funds to keep afloat but will run out at some point shortly. Stretching as much as possible & doing without. 75% of earnings goes towards expenses and the rest is left for us, which isn't much!!",They seem to get more support than people who were born in Canada. Charity begins at home if any extra then we can help
262,Living paycheck to paycheck,Healthy for our country
263,WE PREPARED WELL FOR RETIREMENT BY CONSTANT RESPONSIBILITY AND FRUGALITY AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE NO PROBLEMS.,LEGAL IMMIGRATION OF INDEPENDENT IMMIGRANTS IS GREAT. THEY AND THE COUNTRY BENEFIT BY WELL MATCHED BENEFITS. I KNOW OF ONE YOUNG WOMAN WHO FOUND A GOOD JOB AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS! BUT CHAIN MIGRATION AND ILLEGAL ALIENS COST MONEY FOR THE DILIGENT. BOTH MUST BE STOPPED NOW.
264,very nervous. No savings,Should be screened and reversed if they are found to not be contributing.
265,,
266,Need lower taxes,Too many coming to Canada from United States illegally through Quebec
267,okay,too much in a specific areas
268,trying to keep up  but bills and taxes go up much faster,too many let in in a short time
269,OK,too much of it in non-qualified people we need and we spend more money on them than on the people who have helped built this country
270,I am not very happy about it,I am not very happy about some of the policies
271,currently satisfied but concerned for future,Canada needs LEGAL immigration to maintain the economy. Illegal immigrants must be removed quickly.
272,stayed about the same,should be more open and tolerant
273,No issues,No comments..
274,,
275,,
276,comfortable pension income 75 K,All Canadians except indigenous people are or were immigrants
277,SAME AS BEFORE,
278,,
279,It is slowly getting better,We need tradesmen and doctors and immigration can fill those empty spots
280,It's mediocre,Too many people by-pass the system and sneak in 'illegally'
281,I am being taxed to death and can barely make basic financial commitments,those who immigrate to Canada should only be accepted if they have skills we need or are in fields that we are deficient in.
282,just OK,I agree with all policies.
283,challenging but fun,welcome aboard
284,no extra money to save,no idea
285,Retired on a very limited budget but we manage. You n=must use flyers and plan and buy most things on sale.,"Immigration is what built Canada, in these difficult times one does have to rake extra care however hard it is to ""try"" and filter out radicals."

296,,
297,it is nearly not enough on odsp,they let way too many in
298,ok,It is necessary. But should be controlled. People should be vetted to make sure they are what and who they say they are.

I make decent money bout only seem to be breaking even.","Normally, immigration leads to an expansion of the economy (and certainly to the social fabric of Canada).  But because government has taken over so many aspects of the economy, expansion doesn't happen naturally."
336,On disability and if I didn't do online surveys/watch videos and so on for extra money I wouldn't make it,I feel the more refugees we take in the fewer immigrants should be allowed over.
337,Good. No debt. Sufficient income,No more illegal immigration. Send them back from whence they came. The US is not at war...they are not in danger.

362,We're getting by,Canada has a proud history of making immigrants welcome and allowing them to contribute
363,IT SUCKS,LEGAL IMMIGRATION IS OK BUT SHOULD NOT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT FUNDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS AGAINST THE LAW AND THEY SHOULD BE BARRED FROM EVER ENTERING CANADA AGAIN. WE DON'T NEED CRIMINALS IN CANADA

369,"Getting by, but having more money left over at the end of the month would be good.","It's an absolute joke to let thousands of ""refugees"" into this province (and country) without proper vetting.

We should not change our ways to suit them. THEY SHOULD IMMERSE THEMSELVES INTO OUR SOCIETY.

404,I am very confident that I can maintain my lifestyle,immigration is absolutely necessary for our country to thrive. It may be necessary to do stronger vetting in the future but with a country as large as ours with a small population like ours immigration is very welcome

406,,
407,,

436,no income,hate it
437,"I am extremely concerned, as a senior, about the rising costs of living expenses, i.e. Hydro, water, health care etc., I am lucky to have a full pension plan (or two) and have saved regularly for many years but at this present time worry that we, and many others, do not have enough for our future.","I feel the current immigration is getting out of hand.  Especially in education.  Schools do not have the means to teach a classroom of students if many of those do not speak (or will not try to speak) English.  There should be areas set up especially for children to be able to assimilate them into the education and teach them so they understand the differences in their culture compared to Canadian culture before they get put directly into schools.  Many of the immigrants have come from horrific living/dying conditions and need time to adjust and here again some form of temporary place, especially for school age children so they can adjust and see what behaviour is expected and that they do not need to be afraid and also learn to treat adults, whose charge they will be in, with respect."

448,it could always be better,Canadians come first
449,,
450,Getting harder to save money as price of everything keeps going up but my pensions don't cover the increase.,We should stop immigration until we vet them properly and should not allow them to be subsidized by welfare. We are allowing too many compromises regarding immigrants. If they do not want to assimilate they should leave.
451,"I think that we're getting taxed too much, utilities have gone up too much, the pensions are not getting better and prices are higher than before. Everything is more expensive, and we're barely make ends meet.","I think that Canada is a great place to bring new emigrants and we have the space for them, but I disagree with the fact that most immigrants are located in Toronto, I'm sure that the rest of Ontario would be just as welcoming and helpful and the housing wouldn't be a problem."

455,Trying to live on CPP & OAS with the current financial atmosphere in Ontario has proven to be a challenge,"I think that we should stop taking in immigrants until we can sustain the current population.  Also, they should not be allowed into our country unless they are self-supporting.  As tax-payers we should not pay for them.  They have received a better standard of living than our senior citizens who have lived here, paid taxes and supported themselves all their lives."

Its a struggle to survive.","Canada is doing more than most countries in terms of immigration. This is the best place people could immigrate too. And people know that. It doesn't always benefit though. For example, in Brampton, Indian families are bigger and sometimes wealthier. So the candidate running in the election at the time (last one) wanted to use empty space for large $600,000+ houses only. As oppose to more affordable houses for new homeowners or space for library and parks or businesses to increase employment. This is why I had to vote in the last election. To make sure they did not win."

482,I retired in September 2017. I am 61 years old. I am in a good personal financial situation.,Numbers should be limited. A person who is immigrating should have enough financial resources brought with them to take care of themselves without help from the government.

But I also think we have a large amount of people here from birth suffering so we should spend more to help them to"
491,I feel it is not that good. With the income in Ontario a family can never buy a house.,Immigration is good when the immigrants that come integrate into the society and work to support themselves. However when immigrants come and live on child benefits and welfare it is very unfair for those who work day and night to provide for their family to then have immigrants come and take their tax money while doing nothing.

494,Not very good,Do more screening
495,Not bad but could be better,do not increase

546,It's tight. With two step daughters going to college in the fall it will get even tighter.,My wife and my two step daughters are immigrants so for me I have a different perspective.

623,,
624,Steady but needs improvement.,More background check is needed.
625,need to retain more disposable income...restaurant meals are now more expensive due to higher min. wage. This didn't solve the plight of min. wage workers; it's a social issue put onto the backs of owners who have to let workers go ; shorten hours worked ; and increased their work load. stupid idea.,The bleeding heart liberals are permitting additional family members that are not directly related into this country putting additional strain on our valued social and educational services at the expense of tax paying Canadians.

687,At this stage in my life thought I would have more to live on. but pension stays the same and expenses as well as cost for living keep going up. Not easy being a senior living on a fixed income.,We have way too many. They are putting a strain on social services. we should be taking care of our own people first. As far as jobs they do work in minimum jobs which no one wants to do. But then it means more government handouts because even the immigrants can't make a decent living.

689,I live comfortably,
690,It could do better,Canada needs them

695,We must live very frugally to ensure that we will have enough to live on in the future.,"Many people who immigrate to Canada do not want to be Canadian, they want to maintain their own culture as well as dual citizenship. They are only interested in Canadian benefits. They do not want to be a part of Canada. They stay in their own little groups and Canadians are forced to give up their culture so that they don't hurt the feelings of immigrants."
696,I would like a little less debt and be able to live within my means more.,I feel we make it too challenging for those coming from countries like the UK to work to get citizenship and far too easy for refugees and their families to come over and give them free stuff to start their lives over when. We should in fact help them learn English and get jobs
697,doing ok,positive
698,"Our household pays a lot in taxes and for utilities.

726,Livable at present but could not sustain a life changing negative event,"We are taking in too many, too fast, without thorough background checks and infrastructure to sustain the numbers properly.

727,Extremely positive,"White Canadians born in this country are now the minority! Decrease immigration & stop giving our money away to non-Canadian born citizens.

740,"taxes, insurance is too high along with hydro. had to make ends meet especially on pension",should be done legally not coming through US and walking across border. Hard to check backgrounds
741,Scared,I agree with it but I also think that they need to slow it down

Now we are going on the trillium plan as my husbands plan from work has exceeded and will start back up but not for several months.  Due to all of this we are finding it harder on us and trying to get ready for retirement.,"We all immigrated to Canada at one time.  I know in 1915 my grandparents came from Scotland, Ireland and England.  Looking back at that we all came from somewhere.  Now that being said I have nothing against those coming to Canada but first the government needs to recognize those already living here.  Jobs, our costs of living, our taxes.  How many more can we afford to come into our country?  Lets help those that live here first and stop the immigration until that is better."
747,I would like to earn more money but my profession does not leave room for this,too many immigrants are coming to Canada and we have too many people in our own country who need assistance.  These should be taken care of first.
748,low income,they should helped but not given extra benefits
749,great customer service,it should be more strict
750,Not very good.,There is more support for immigrants than the Ontario/Canadian indigenous population and that is NOT okay.
751,getting by,way too much immigration coming into Canada
752,not enough to buy basic necessities,too laxed

We certainly can't afford that!",We are too liberal letting almost anyone into Canada giving them free health care housing etc. when our Canadian born are pushed back in the line for health care education etc.
754,"Positive, I raised money for retirement and for family needs and for living comfortable (I was raising money from the age 25, from the first day on my own). I knew it that was the best decision) and today I am a winner.","Immigration could become more than positive, could become a benefactor to Canadian economy - IF Canada will made the right decision about.

 Immigrants come from very poor countries, without of opportunity for jobs and peaceful living, with living on edge of almost starvation in they past life and no place to stay with family and kids, with kids not in schools. 

IF CANADA WELCOME THEM ""IN"" - THEN - - CANADA COULD SEND THEM TO NORTH PROVINCES AND ALL WHERE CANADA NEED PEOPLE TO WORK AND POPULATE OURS LAND - WE WILL WIN ON THAT DECISION!!!

Immigrants will be happy and welcome there, got jobs, populate empty places, open new companies, businesses and support farmers as well, but ... before Government must help to that happened and quick build there new schools and also can ask publicly all business owners to start build and investing in a opening new places there to create jobs for immigrants to work in up North. 

In big cities immigrants are not to much ""wanted"" by Canadians and not to ""liked"", because of fact of competitions for jobs and because  without of jobs they are looking for 

a Welfare, so and Immigrants innocent kids who come first time to big cities are introduced by margin and criminals to drugs and illegal activities. 

WHEN CANADA ARE INVITING IMMIGRANTS, MUST TO HAVE A GOOD PLANS FOR THEM,WHEN THEY IN.it look like is no plan and someone fail when open door then just live them hopeless - for them self."
755,I would like to be better situated financially at this stage in my life however pay rates from companies have not kept up with the cost of living increases.,I think that we need to slow down the immigration numbers simply because we cannot support the population we have now and choosing to increase the population would be detrimental to everyone living here now.

So, we are comfortable from a financial perspective.","Canada was built on immigrants.

765,real estate market slow down is hitting hard on our personal finance.  That was the major source of our income and it's really down.,"I feel that Canada's immigration policy for refugee makes Canada look good in front of the entire world but is it really working for Canadians.  A BIG NO.. Canada has forgotten to reunite the families, Siblings,  They need to think about the mental health of their citizens and bring a policy to reunite the families.  Isn't that also a humanity. Stop pretending good in front of the world. one way to help is let the families or siblings to immigrate to northern Canada.  They need people there. At least they will be in the same country.  Family plays a important role in overall mental health.  Lot of mental health issues will disappear."

767,I was always very careful. I have saved money and have a small pension. Thus I am ok.,Immigrants often take jobs that people here won't take. There is difficulty with housing. most immigrants work hard and try to get on in Canada.
768,,
769,Overwhelmed...must use savings to keep bills up to date,Doesn't seem to be enough screening...don't think that immigrants should receive more help than seniors or single parents
770,getting worse,they need to speed up the progress
771,,
772,"I am comfortable, with nothing to complain about. Just wish I had a bit more left over for furniture purchases.",I like to see new people coming into Canada. It opens our eyes to others values and beliefs.
773,Ok,Need better screening but generally its a good thing.
774,I feel stressed and anxious.,I think immigrants add to the diversity of our country.
775,double income and still struggling!,no comment
776,,
777,"getting by with a few luxuries, but could be better",I feel we have done our part for helping other countries and now it's time to help our own country and stopping sending money to other countries or bringing in immigrants that takes away jobs and housing for our own citizens. The immigrants are being treated better than our own countries Inuit and natives who were here first!
778,,"The immigration of Canada should carefully check the persons background, criminal and police clearance before sending to our beautiful land of peace and prosperity in Canada. Do not allow fraud, corruption and criminal people from other countries without checking their family and personal background."
779,struggling,"I don't have a problem with immigration per say. What I disagree with is people being handed everything on a silver platter upon arrival before they've ever contributed a thing to our great country.



I, myself, am an immigrant and had to work my butt off for everything I've ever gotten.  My family had to wait years before we were allowed to apply for citizenship.  We had to assimilate to the Canadian culture.  We Worked hard at multiple jobs (often concurrently), paid taxes, and contributed to our community in many ways, including becoming business owners and creating employment for others as well as ourselves.  I see all of these things as positive.  They create a culture and mindset of contribution and not of entitlement.



The current immigration policies are far too lax and are creating a society that feels entitled to anything and everything they want.  No wonder our society is coming apart at the seems.  Stop the nonsense once and for all."
780,Concerned about ability to pay for rising costs of everything,Too many being allowed and that increases our cost as everything I should provided for them....those of us who have worked for everything get less
781,I feel I always struggle,They take our work so not good.
782,A bit anxious,I think it's great and we should be doing more!
783,"Not good. I would like it to be

a bit better.",Not a good thing.
784,I would like it to be better,There needs to be careful screening
785,Ok,Its good but need better screening
786,,
787,It's not enough,Job loss for Canadian and the same rights .
788,ITS GOOD AT THE MOMENT BUT IF THE LIBERALS OR NDP GET IN POWER THEN IT WILL GET WORSE,IT IS LETTING IN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY BUT DRAIN OUR SYSTEMS BY ALLOWING THEM TO BRING IN THERE FAMILY AND MEMBERS OF THERE EXTENDED FAMILY AND WE GIVE THEM WELFARE AND HEALTH CARE FOR FREE AT A COST TO THE TAX PAYER WHILE OUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES LIVE ON THE STREETS WHILE THESE REFUGEES ARE GIVEN ANYTHING THEY NEED
789,comfortable but with room for improvement,"Canada is doing well with it, immigration is needed here"
790,Stable,Fine
791,living,satisfied
792,Could be better if certain expenses were less.,"Immigration is good for Canada, however, Canada needs immigrants that can sustain themselves, contribute to society, the economy and the country without being a burden to the rest of the population."
793,"We're getting by, I know that there are rebates on hydro, but it is still much higher than it used to be","My parents are immigrants from Ireland, I feel like it is a part of our Canadian culture to have a diverse immigrant community"
794,bad,too many
795,My financial situation is okay.,nothing
796,,
797,"Satisfied, enough in reserve to continue comfortable retirement.","Kept it going, especially skilled immigrants."
798,everything is getting expensive and the pension does increase proportionally,they are goo much pampered
799,its ok,it's ok
800,,
801,,
802,great,
803,I was doing okay until the price of fuel started to empty my wallet,"WE HAVE HOMELESS, WE HAVE WOUNDED SOLDIERS AND WE SPEND WAY TOO MUCH ON PEOPLE FLEEING THEIR HOMELANDS/ THEN COME TO CANADA AND BRING THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THEM"
804,Very good,Don't know
805,bljbb,
806,unsatisfied,"ok in general, though not if they're just going to go on welfare and be a drain"
807,,
808,"staying afloat, able to pay the bills.","badly needed to fill jobs, that Canadians won't do"
809,could be better,I don't mind
810,going well,it's ok
811,,
812,"I do not like my current personal financial situation. I wish it was better, so I could be prepared in the future.","Immigration is bad for Canada. The government wastes money on immigrants. The immigrants just take jobs away from citizens, and they increase the crime rate."
813,surviving,immigrants should come in through the regular process not just walk across the border.  everyone should apply not walk in and ask.
814,It is Ok,We have taken in too many people and we are paying for it.
815,Pretty nasty,I don't like it I want all the jobs
816,Strong and healthy.,Adds to our levels of diversity.
817,,
818,not enough for bills,it's great for the economy
819,I am working multiple jobs to make ends meet.,I am for immigrants coming to Canada as long as they share the country's values and not going to leach off of welfare.
820,it has its struggles but I can make it work,we should limit how many
821,,
822,presently out of job and hence in precarious situation. Looking to minimum basic income guarantee from the Govt.,"It's one 

of the best country to immigrate and settle down."
823,Very concerned,It's not perfect but we need to do what we can to help others
824,It's hard to live on disability,"They drain resources, Canada should take care of it's own people for a change, it's disgusting what that idiot Trudeau did favouring immigration, we deserve someone like Trump!"
825,,
826,IT SUCKS,GOOD IDEA
827,It sucks. The rich get richer and I get poorer.  When does the struggle for the middle and lower class stop.,Doesn't bother me one bit.
828,Getting by ok,A small amount is fine
829,,
830,I am doing ok as long as I remain employed.,It is out of control.
831,Fucked man,"Its good because Canada is built upon immigration, however at this point its pointless because people are getting in faster through illegal immigration than legal immigration"
832,Satisfied,"Unless you are ABORIGINAL, you are an IMMIGRANT! Immigration is what makes Canada a great multicultural country."
833,Not available,Not available
834,Work too much for too little pay. Worry about helping my aging parents,Fine with it
835,Needs improvement,It is good for Canada.
836,terrible,too much
837,Living cheque to cheque.,Have to slow down the number of immigrants being let into this country.
838,confident in my ability to budget,"I think immigration is better for Canada.  We are the second largest country yet our population is extremely low.  By having people settle in areas other then Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, we can expand greatly.  This would hopefully boost Canada as an economic power comparative to our allies."
839,,
840,,Ok
841,,
842,Living comfortably,Our country thrives on legal immigration
843,It is now fine.,We must do it in a measured way and not allow too many in at any one time.
844,"it is very tight, costs keep going up but the quality in return for those costs either stays the same or gets worse","Immigration is the number one reason why old-stock Canadians cannot find a job or at least a decent job, cannot afford rent let alone a decent home but immigrants have bought up real estate and driven up the cost of living ill-proportionately to the clime in the economy"
845,I am living week to week,I don't like it
846,Living on ODSP is far from easy. Money received does not meet the needs of even our small family. Not all bills are covered because food has to be gotten.,"I think immigration should be lessened. As new immigrants arrive in Canada, those that were born here find getting a job harder and harder."
847,I feel sad living month to month,I feel like Canada is already in debt so stop bringing more people here to live off of the government
848,My debt is what's killing me right now,I think it's a good thing. It helps our country grow and having different cultures teaches us new things. We learn from them as they learn from us.
849,"I think it's ok , but wages are too low for expenses in Ontario.",I think it focuses too much on certain groups.
850,I'm terrified what could happen to it if Doug Ford is elected.  I could end up homeless.,They'll be much more productive in society than the very rich and the right-leaning percentage of our population.
851,Financial hardship,Canadian government should ensure Canadians have housing and jobs before allowing a NY immigration
852,Its about good pretty much,It should be like that
853,"Manageable, but below comfortable level at the moment",It defines Canada
854,,
855,Okay...not great...I can handle my bills and some recreation.,I am mostly happy with immigrants coming to Canada legally.
856,I have debt.,I'm a child of an immigrant
857,,
858,Poor,Not good
859,"I can't afford to live due to high cost hydro, gasoline and cable costs. I'm forced to sell my feels in order to supplement my basic living needs.",It had real value in Canada's past...but now it's a haven't for people looking to get a free ride on our system.
860,,
861,Being retired due to disability my financial situation is difficult.,Some fixes are need to deal with illegal entry. Better tracking of individuals is necessary. Process needs to be speeded up.
862,It's been improving lately and this makes me happy.,A few immigrants are okay.
863,Worried,Getting tired of them coming in and getting such an easier time while us born here struggle
864,There's always room for improvement.,"As an immigrant myself, I'm very positive about the potential impact they can have on our country."
865,CCP Disability,No Quebec jumping. All illegals should be sent back and enter through the legal process
866,Pay cheque to pay cheque,It's part of what Canada is all about.
867,Stressed,tighten it up.
868,"I have cut my expenses to the bone but pay 1/4 of my pension for my grandchildren's education because the Liberals make public education hostile for Christian children with their immoral sex-ed, removed Christianity while introducing Islam from schools, and refuse or give fair tax breaks to pay a portion for alternative education. This has place a financial burden that is only getting worse with my former employer refusing to increase my pension to keep up with inflation. My property taxes also keep going up yet I live next to someone on welfare who rents out her apartment to a couple people. I grow a lot of my own food and purchase as much as possible anything I need on sale. I have reduced my driving, walk when ever I can and help my children with their finances. I only go on vacation to places that I pay little in order to reduce expenses.",Harper brought in true refugees who faced genocide in their own countries but Trudeau is bringing in immigrants many who are not refugees but hate Christians and are taught to subjugate them to the point of death. Canadians can not afford to bring the world in and give them everything they want so the government needs to crack down and only bring in those who not only need protection but are willing to contribute to society.
869,"It is okay, we get by",It is what Canada needs to succeed. I was populated by people of other countries that brought all their trades here and I think it should continue if Canada wants to succeed
870,very good,some are ok
871,,
872,I am very comfortable,we need to tighten up our screening processes
873,just ok,Too lax and letting too many in
874,"TWO words: It SUCKS!!!! EVERY political leader on the PLANET, are corrupt, thieving, liars.!!!!!",Two words: GO HOME. I am a non entity In my own country!!!!
875,struggling to meet financial obligations,More rigid screening should be used.
876,"Not the best, but otherwise content.","Potentially an issue if immigrants don't integrate into and get to know their new communities, but otherwise neutral."
877,Could be better,Cost taxpayers too much money
878,"""Precarious"", but still barely holding on.","If managed properly, it could be good. At present, I am not sure if it is good."
879,I live pay check to pay check,We should take care of the people that are already here before we allow more to come.
880,Retired...Difficult enough as Lady Wynn would gladly take what ever she can of my income...and anybody else..,Disaster...Our Government has no idea whom they are allowing into our country and Mr. Trudeau is all for it. Finding his next Camera seems to be his main concern. Ask the Veterans about our PM. Now there is a story...
881,I'm ok,too lax
882,all is good,too lenient
883,worse as mortgage rates have gone up and the hydro along with cost of everyday living because increase in minimum wage,More should be done to connect people with their loved ones and make it easier
884,its ok,it's decent
885,"It could be better, but we're comfortable",We should let in less folks with extreme religious views.
886,no,bad
887,I work in an industry whose long term future is in serious doubt,I feel most anti-immigration sentiment is rooted in bigotry
888,steady,enough is enough
889,It ok but few more dollars would be great,Nothing
890,It is fine,Necessary but should be cost neutral.  Immigrants should not cost me they should be able to be easily integrated on their own with minimal financial help from governments.
891,could be better,Too many non working non tax paying people that receive more than those that have worked all their lives for their families.
892,very comfortable    I do not have to think about what I want to buy over $5000.  I have absolutely no debt. Larger expenditures are always saved for.,I am so proud that Canada is taking in refugees from other countries.
893,not good cannot afford to retire,I have no problem helping other people out but it start at home first ????
894,fair just live able,should be helped
895,coping,too many coming in to Canada
896,not comfortable  pension has not gone up with cost of living,too much at once
897,I'm ok can make my cost of living and save a few dollars,we have done enough lets help our own
898,retired but comfortable,"keep it controlled better, the PM's does not have a policy"
899,have a good plan in place,slow it down
900,"while it is fine, gas and hydro are examples of items far stripped inflation, carbon tax is a waste of time",overall it is a positive however a small minority is making a bad name for the large majority
901,pretty good,I don't really care
902,Ok,None
903,"retired, pension does not increase","Canada is allowing too many illegal immigrants to cross our borders, making it

it impossible to properly ensure they are

not criminals/undesirables etc."
904,Very comfortable,Very good thing for Canada; but need to select the appropriate candidates to enter
905,I have cut my cloth to suit my patter. I have enough to do most of what I want to do.,The screening process needs to be made more efficient.
906,very comfortable,it's over all immigrants in Canada
907,"We are doing well on about 45,000 / year. Not rich but doing ok.",I feel we should be open but make sure we properly vet those coming in.
908,,
909,its not very great,not sure
910,have not worked in almost a year!!!!!!!! this is because of the fucking system keeps fucking me!!!!!!!!!!!,enough already!
911,Could be worse.,"Not against it, but it needs work."
912,I am on tender hooks but feel hopeful I can earn enough for bills and saving through self-employment doing video work for small business.,It's important to allow people from other countries here for humanitarian reasons and also helps our economy. But we must be ever vigilant about bad apples and those who want to impose their customs on us.
913,they stink,no answer
914,self inflicted decisions have made my situation,"it would be nice if immigrants could have their specific qualifications, better recognised"
915,,
916,I am OK worked hard for 40 years and prepared for retirement,this country was built on immigration and over all things are quite good a little adjustments now and then now and then should be fine
917,Okay,No comment
918,Safe,Free ride
919,I have sufficient funds to live and to do extra activities when I wish to.,Immigration is necessary and good for the country in general and adds to our economic progress.
920,ok,needs screening. Let educated contributors come in not just Muslims with no integration thoughts. Allow only people with a desire to integrate into Canadian society
921,Stagnant,Don't over do it
922,not good,crap
923,worse off,hopeful
924,Ok but hydro and gasoline eat away at income,We are becoming very diverse. Some concern Canadian identity will be diluted
925,I am comfortable with my personal financial situation,I think Canada is on the right track. Balance skilled immigrants with humanitarian efforts for those who face hardship in their country of origin
926,It's not enough to get by on,"It's ridiculous. All these immigrants are claiming to flee their country, yet instead of coming here for a new life, they're taking advantage of the Canadian government, taking all the jobs and trying to impose their beliefs on us like trying to take away our Christmas tree, pork, etc. I drive forklift and because of all the Indian men as managers, they refuse to let women drive forklift, regardless of 10 years + experience and being more qualified. They cheat the driving tests so our insurance rates are through the roof because they don't know the rules of the road and they intentionally cause accidents to fraud the insurance companies. I'm white and I've become a minority in my own city. They won't let you rent an apartment unless you're Indian, rent has skyrocketed for a dumpy apartment because they don't care to maintain it, they just want the money and they don't even pay taxes on rent income so people on disability etc. can't find apartments. It has to stop"
927,,
928,"Comfortable, but cost of living is getting higher",Less housing and jobs for Canadian citizens
929,If I didn't watch how I use my money I would be in trouble,These people are willing to work for less than Canadians
930,On the line,Good opportunities for others in Canada
931,Satisfied but wish god pension was higher,
932,I live fairly comfortable,"Canada lets too many into our country, takes away our jobs and crime goes up. It seems the immigrate has more rights then a true Canadian does"
933,Ok,Good for country
934,,
935,Not good because of bills,We need to help immigrants
936,We are doing OK. We try to save more  money than spend and use less electricity. We find ways to save money on deals that companies offer.,The taxpayer is paying way too much money to have these refugees in Canada. They get everything free and live on welfare the rest of their lives and do not assimilate to our way of culture. They think they can have the same rules and laws of their own country.
937,"vulnerable, uncertain, can't keep up.","Canada is a great country for immigrants who want to make a new life for themselves. However, Canada has to revise the 3rd safe country act. It looks like this agreement is exposing a weakness in Canada's willingness to accept refugees and has opened a wide hole where everyone can slip through. This is costing taxpayers way more than the system can handle. We need a revision to this agreement ASAP."
938,"As I age, I'm more stressed and worry constantly about how I'm going to look after myself when I retire.","I love being a Canadian and it's mainly because we don't close our doors to anyone. We are peacekeepers, we are caring and that's what makes us the place to be. We are stronger because of it."
939,OK,ok
940,,
941,Living comfortably but not exceptionally.,It increases national diversity.
942,,We should welcome all.
943,"It's awful. Even though I have a better job now, we're still struggling to get by.",It's fine! Totally cool with it
944,I feel I can manage in hope that nothing unexpected would happen.,"Immigration is necessary for prosperity of Canada. Being the second largest country in the world with population of only 36 million, we need more working people who will contribute once they get jobs, pay taxes and boost Canadian economy. Canada's immigration policy is just fine."
945,Makes me depressed,Good for the country if done correctly
946,,
947,Impossible,Neutral
948,Its tough,I feel that it's ok. Canada is a great place to live
949,Okay,Allowed as long as immigrant has no crime record
950,Drowning in debt!,Diversity is good.  We do a good job of screening immigrant backgrounds.
951,We have control over our financial situation but also know that we are responsible to support our social services as well so don't mind paying a little more.,We need immigrants to keep our economy strong and allow other people in the world to have the opportunities our ancestors had to prosper.
952,,
953,Struggling greatly to get out of debt,The screening needs to be tightened up
954,It could be better,I immigrated to Canada.  I feel immigration is necessary but should be stricter.
955,,
956,Need more money.,Too slack... Need to take care of our own before bringing more in.
957,it could be better,I don't have a problem as long as when they come they help themselves as well
958,I am in trouble,No comment
959,can live on what I make but could always use a bit more for some extras,certain amount of immigration is okay but large numbers at once is too hard on the infrastructure of the area where they come to.
960,ESPADRILLE,ESPADRILLE
961,we definitely make a good amount of money but gas hydro and groceries are killing us.,I feel they are taking over and taking all the services that should be for Canadians. they are changing they way we live and our values
962,Stable.,Fantastic. We are a welcoming country (generally) and should be accepting of all.
963,"It's hard to live in Ontario. I would love to be able to buy a condo, but even I can't afford it with my salary",No comment
964,"I live on Old Age and CPP and live in a ""geared to rent"" apartment and get .approx. $1500. per month. Rent is 600$",People need to live in peace and harmony.
965,,
966,Starting to struggle. Husband on disability pension,We are having hard time keeping our people fed and clothed
967,,
968,My income is staying the same but the cost of living is going up,I support it but think it needs reform
969,I think we are being taxed to the point where I can't afford anything.,"While immigration can be a good thing, providing free health care and providing support (welfare) is taxing the system and not helping Canada at all."
970,OK.  I have a work pension plus CPP and OAS.  Enough $ to get by.,"Depends.  Excessive with mid-eastern ""refugees"".  Could be more encouraged from ""developed"" or stable countries."
971,it could be better,the borders should be closed until Canada can take care of the problems WE already HAVE!!!
972,,
973,"If my husband lost his job we'd be screwed, as it is he works away from home because of the Wynne government.  Financially we are making it but just, we're comfortable (we eat, we pay our bills) but that's it.  no vacations, no extras, if a big expense came in we'd be screwed.","Besides Natives the whole damn country is made up of immigrants and their descendants, heck my parents and my husbands parents were immigrants.  If not for immigrants this country wouldn't be what it is today.  So long as we make every immigrant able to be successful and have a good life I say lets help who we can."
974,,
975,BAD,GOOD
976,We are ok. We can save for the future. We can do just about everything we want to given planning.,I wish that more could be done for refugees when they first come to Canada in terms of interpreters and people helping them figure things out. It's such a big change.
977,I feel comfortable.,
978,Could be a lot better,"Good in some ways, good to be multi cultural, however shouldn't give them more rights than Canadians who were born here"
979,,
980,tax is too high for my level,too bad
981,Not much savings,It helps to high the financial  growth
982,,
983,It is very difficult to make ends meet. Costs are always increasing but wages stay the same,I understand providing a home for immigrants but the government is giving them more financial assistance than the retired people that have worked in our country there whole lives
984,"I'm comfortable, as long as no big expenses pop up","immigration has always been the life blood of Canada; with the large aging population, we need influxes of people to take seniors' places, and to care for them"
985,I am coping with the income I have and maybe a little better off now that circumstances have changed due to moving back to Canada from the USA,I believe that strong background checks should be done and that immigrants should not get a free ride and should be able to support themselves from the day they are allowed to enter Canada under our laws and immigration standards
986,I have enough to pay my bills...but not much else..,too many have been allowed to come in...you don't know what the outcome will be in future years. I hope the proper screening was done so we don't let in a bunch of hate groups in..
987,,
988,Just meeting the monthly bills at best month to month.  Any emergency will tip the scales disastrously.,I support selectively.  We need to impose mandatory jobs and relocation to communities (i.e. rural) that require population to sustain themselves.
989,No scope for savings,some loopholes in the policies on bringing in refugees need to be fixed
990,,
991,Stable,"Too lenient. 

Fix our country before bending over backwards to accommodate others."
992,I am very afraid because I have no benefits at all..,enough for now
993,,It's not beneficial for the Canadians
994,,
995,"I am just barely getting by.  I make minimum wage, and have no dependants so there are no benefits for me such as hydro rebates, child credits etc.","We have let way too many in.  You can't tell me that they have all been properly screened, and a lot of them aren't really even refugees.  They just wanted out and Canada provides them with a free ride"
996,"Since I lost my husband , things have  gotten worse ; this has all happened in the last 5 years living on survivors  benefits and old age pension does not help me much ; some months you pick one thing you cannot pay; have had phone cut off, satellite cut off ; hydro was okay because they  cannot cut off in winter have applied for guaranteed income ; that was 8 months ago have not heard from them yet thanks for your time",
997,,
998,could be better,"in general the system makes sense but refugees are a bit of a burden, they don't go through the same selection process - unfair"
999,It could be better,Not great they are taking everything
1.00E+03,It could be better,I'm an immigration myself and people from all walks of life contributes to the overall Canadian economy
1001,need help from government less taxes more money for low income/disability,"immigration is fine, we're pretty much all immigrants at some point. Just wish people that have been here all their lives would get the new cars, houses etc."
1002,its so bad,I'm not for it. it takes away a lot from our country
1003,"Good, I try to keep my spending low","Given our birth rates, it is required"
1004,My personal financial situation has gotten worse because my husband and I have retired and its not enough money to survive on,The crime rate is getting too high because they are not checking those people properly coming into the country
1005,Fine,Neutral
1006,"So many low income and minimum wage people are in deep trouble, for us we had to move north and buy LITERALLY a shack for 24,000 so we would not be on the street. We could not live in the city any longer impossible to do, so we sold everything we had to buy the shack to at least have a roof and not a tent. My husband has Parkinson's and I am his caregiver and we try to live every month off of NOTHING! We have considered suicide almost every month!","It is amazing how Canada is with the immigrants, funny if you went to any of their countries they would either arrest you, shoot you, hold you for ransom or GOD knows what else worse. There are a lot of good and innocent people who do not deserve this in their countries I would not wish this on anyone but Canada should fix their own problems and country first! They think they are doing a good thing but all they are doing is taking our country down into nothing. One day we will all be extremely sorry for bringing in all of these immigrants for so many reasons. Our government really needs to open their eyes and smarten up!! Why do they care more about immigrants than their own people. They bitch about the poor and low income but who made them that way?"
1007,It sucks,Not really sure
1008,retired and living modestly. few years until old age pension kicks in.,I think it's become too much.
1009,"as a pensioner I think that after my husband and I paid high income taxes we should be entitled to a reduction of taxes.  We paid or daycare, received no child benefits because of a dual income and because e both started our careers before the age of 20 were penalized by having our CPP reduced when we took it at age 60 because we retired at 55 leaving 5 years of no contributions to CPP.  I pay 1200 dollars monthly of income tax which is more than social assistant recipients receive.  I feel seniors deserve a break.","If you apply for a visa and are accepted the welcome to Canada.  If you cross the border illegally you are a drain on our financial resources and are forcing those in line to wait longer.

1018,I am concerned that soon I will not be able to afford to live on my own due to increased oil/gas prices. Increased taxing and hydro.,"I feel we have enough people in our country already who are in dire need of assistance/jobs and education. I feel our tax dollars should help more of the people(citizens and landed immigrants equally) who are already here and desperately need help, especially those requiring medical, mental or long term health care."
1019,,
1020,live comfortably but do not have much of disposable income left,there is to much immigration
1021,Scared and angry,Angry that there is much more crime and killings with less jobs for those who have worked hard and were born here
1022,stable,"Immigration is important to all countries, however, I find Canada to be much more lenient/easier in its considerations.  There should be tighter rules/regulations."

1025,Not to good,Not sure yet
1026,it's not where I want it to be,it's a great thing
1027,I earn enough to live comfortable and I am totally satisfied. I don't go after unnecessary luxuries.,"Present day Canada is build up on immigrants, they should continue this as it is. Everyone or their ancestors except first nations is an immigrant. Whether it is immigrants or not there will always be some kinds of issues."
1028,good but could be better,good
1029,"Only in a good position compared to prior because we have been discharged from bankruptcy, and are renting at below market-value from my in-laws",It's our heritage
1030,I am a little worried about my retirement years,How many immigrants can we afford to support?  And how many become productive citizens contributing to the country and how many are a drain on our economy?
1031,"Pay cheque to pay cheque, simple life with 6 people one income.","Canada should help to find jobs before giving Immigration to people.

 This way newcomers have money and the will not go to welfare. This way government will have money to spend on other good things like kids education, abused women, etc."
1032,,
1033,I feel bad about my financial situation,I think it's leaving actual Canadians without jobs housing as well as other things
1034,,
1035,Serious health issues have hit our home using every dollar we had and more to point husband needs life important drugs and we can't get them welfare say no fighting to get keep to give it yet he is now on cop disability,Don't mind helping out but it was our country first we should have taken care of ourselves first not treated worse then immigrants
1036,,
1037,,
1038,I am often struggling To make ends meet,I think we are spending way too much money on helping other countries when our country is suffering. Less jobs and more taxes being paid to help them. Sure help them out but not at our cost
1039,,
1040,Okay,Okay
1041,could be better,take care of our own first
1042,Ok,Open to it
1043,,
1044,I am retired and the pension money I put into RRSPs and RIFs will run out in 2 years. I have had to increase my withdrawals to cover the escalating cost of living for everything from A to Z. I will soon have to ask for assistance of some kind.,"We should be a land of equality regardless of colour, creed or religious beliefs.  Harmony can be achieved with better understanding of the differences and that which is common in all persons."
1045,It's bad. Everything is expensive and companies don't pay enough for hard work,Immigrants built this country long time ago but I don't agree with bringing all refugees who don't work and get money from government. It takes money from people who work honest and refugees don't do anything good for the country
1046,As a retired person the cost of living does not come up to cost of living!!,"Immigration to Canada is best if done through people who are citizens and can aid newcomers about life, shopping, and what we need for seasonal needs."
1047,Comfortable,It is in line with our country's basic principles. Important to set limits on numbers and to ensure services/jobs are available to support them.
1048,In good shape,If they have been properly vetted and work for a living; not welfare or social assistance they are good for the country.
1049,"not good, unemployed and using savings to pay bills",We should watch how many we allow in. There are a lot of unemployed people here that were born in Canada. We need to have jobs for ourselves too
1050,Scared for the future,In controlled amounts it's a great thing

1057,"The rich get richer, the poor get the entire blow....help us Lord!","Fair practice is needed. Never tolerate refugees who end up being part of terrorism, using Canada as gateway to infiltrate their ideologies. Scrutinize them and carefully, check their backgrounds recruited by terrorist groups. Leaning towards them and pampering them through financial support for all we know they are funded by much larger influential group of terrorist. Should their financial support be more than what citizens and seniors are getting? We pay taxes they just came never had the chance to work, do they really need to work living comfortably in this country??? You be the judge... God bless us..."
1058,I'm stable,"People need a safe place to live. And as long as they're able to adapt into a new society, I see this as helping them live a better life they deserve."
1059,"AS A MIDDLE CLASS SINGLE MATURE WORKING FULL TIME I DON'T SEEM TO GET ANY BREAKS AT ALL. IT ALL GOES TO FAMILIES AND THOSE ON ASSISTANCE OF SOME SORT. I'VE HAD NO BREAKS AT ALL IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WITH THE COST OF LIVING GOING UP ABOUT 2% PER YEAR AND GETTING LESS THAN THAT IN A RAISE WHAT WAS WORTH $20 IN MY BANK ACCOUNT 4 YEARS AGO IS NOW ONLY WORTH ABOUT $18.85. I'VE WORKED FULL TIME MY WHOLE LIFE, BROUGHT UP TWO DAUGHTERS WHO BOTH HAVE DEGREES AND FULL TIME JOBS AND I GET NO BREAKS FOR ANYTHING",I'M ALL FOR IMMIGRATION TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE VETTING AND FOLLOW UP.
1060,"It could be better.

Everything has gone up too high in price.",I feel we need to help are own before letting others in.
1061,I work in security and feel that it should have a higher than minimum wage,We should stop accepting immigrants
1062,I lost my job thanks to the Liberal policies and more people will lose theirs if the increases to wage and vacation time continue,too many and the finances cannot cope
1063,There is no help for seniors. Most of us are living with our kids,Most immigrants are willing to work if given the chance

1071,I don't much like it. It's hard making ends meet.,I feel they think we should take everything that upset them about Canada like the National Anthem and lord's prayer out of our school is totally wrong...they would not do that for us if we went to their country...so if they don't like they need to go back to their own country.
1072,"With the cost of food going up so much and hydro being so expensive I'm really getting concerned as to how I'm going to manage to afford a healthier meal plan and due to health issues I wouldn't survive the summer without air conditioning, but can I afford to run it.",I think extreme limits should be put in place.  I live in Toronto and the minority is now white people and actually has been for some time now.  I find a lot of the new immigrants are inconsiderate and have no idea how to behave.  They take up the blue seats on public transport and have a hissy fit when asked to vacate for those that need it.  They push in front in grocery lines and they're constantly begging for money in public places.

1083,With every thing going up my pension is falling behind,in todays population we need immigration as to increase Canadas population
1084,"It's comfortable, but not truly affluent",I believe that immigration brings fresh insights into the country's overall outlook
1085,Okay,Good
1086,not enough,it is good

1088,need help,good if they leave there believes in the country they came from
1089,,
1090,Lousy,Too easy
1091,ok,ok
1092,It is presently good because I do almost nothing and try to keep my spending low each month,It could be improved by tightening the rules on entry and reducing by 50% the numbers allowed into the country starting in 2019. This reduction in immigrants should be in effect for the next 5 years.
1093,,
1094,,
1095,,
1096,,
1097,it could be better if racism was better targeted,they are doing the best that they can without discriminating people like Donald Trump does
1098,Living cheque to cheque and having an impossible time making ends meet,I think we do not have a large need for immigrants and should prioritize our resources for our own first
1099,Need to pay down debt.,Immigrants are less likely to be criminal and more productive then anti-immigrants.

1101,less income coming in because I cannot lend borrowers money on mortgages due to changing regulations,

1103,Happy. Would like prices especially gasoline to stop jumping all over. Then I could save a bit more money and buy more expensive items,Look after our own people before giving the sky to immigrants. Reduce quotas
1104,Sucks,Too many
1105,"Providing the economy doesn't slump, I should make out ok",We need to increase influx of immigrants who apply legally
1106,My situation is that my finances are being picked at to the point where I can't see any progress in my overall value,"Immigration is required, but verifying who they are should be toughened up."

1109,,
1110,shitty,Hate is a strong word but Brampton and jobs with immigrants is causing a shit storm
1111,"Could be better, but not too bad.",I think it should slow down for a while as we really can't afford the numbers that will be coming in.
1112,It's reasonable but I worry about possible  future issues,It's ruining the long standing traditions our ancestors fought and died for

 we are doing OK",we're mostly doing things right.

I need to be on a special diet & we don't get enough money. Our rent is ok for the next 2-3 years. We worry about money often.,I think that it's a great thing. Most peoples ancestry come from other places/countries around the world. My ancestors are from Ireland. I've also wanted to go & see where my ancestors started. In my mind 85% of all Canadians are immigrants. Whether they're new immigrants or old immigrants dating back a few hundred years. That's my opinion. No one person nor group should be singled out.
1125,Things are tight living pay check to pay check,Most new immigrants today do nothing (including becoming fluent in English) to assimilate themselves into Canadian culture. Their sole purpose is to take advantage of the good Canada offers but maintain their own culture and identity from religion to dress to food to language.
1126,"My financial situation is alright at this time.  However, the current government is moving in directions that will make my financial situation more and more precarious over the coming years.",Immigration is a benefit to Canada when it is controlled and managed. Allowing floods of illegal migrants to settle in Canada is not.

1128,Could be better if the industry I work in had government subsidies,Neutral
1129,it sucks,ok
1130,I am comfortable but I feel more money is being taken away from discretionary spending due to the increased cost of living in Ontario and Canada.,This country was founded on immigrants. Immigration is essential to the growth of this country.
1131,Government pension - Ontario and CCP are just barely enough to maintain. I slowly sell things to help make ends meet with some room for an occasional luxury,It has helped make Canada

1150,,
1151,,
1152,I got the minimum wage increase,I don't mind if they're good people that don't cause any problems. The only problem is that they're taking good paying jobs from Canadians
1153,"I spent many years establishing my education, of which I paid for, and have a proud career in the health care profession.  To be reduced to pay check to pay check living due to healthcare cuts and dealing with ever rising gas and hydro rates. Makes me feel the current government is only concerned with lining their pockets and not for the province as a whole. The northern part of the province is regularly forgotten and seem to be only on the liberals and pc's radar at times of election. These parties forget some of your educated voters lay in the northern territories aiding and caring for and aging population, and not solely in the cities where you cater to more.","I understand their situations and issues as to why they chose to come to Canada. If in the same predicament I would want the aid as well. However when their means are completely covered and paid for by the government with money paid for by the increasing taxes placed on the Canadian citizens, a sour taste begins to form. Both my husband and I are well educated and we should not have to struggle to live."

1155,I could use a break in all of the high prices we are paying now especially for groceries,No comment
1156,Paying too much in taxes and not seeing much benefit.  Gas costs are affecting day to day expenses considerably.,"That we are not attracting the kind of immigrants that respect our Canadian culture and many of them are not hard working. Compared to previous years, many of them end up on welfare.  This did not happen in the early years of immigration, when people came to work hard and improve their lives with their own hard work."
1157,"Not much difference, still the same for the past years","Good rules, but the refugees, they should not give them lots of money, they help little bit it's ok, but not giving them more because they will become lazy and  they just  depend on the money that they are getting from the government. We people who're paying tax are not happy about that. To think that they get more than the people who work their asses to pay for tax, example the seniors."

1159,"Not difficult, but not as easy as it has been","I have no problem with people from other countries coming to Canada, but would like them to be able to contribute, not get so many hand-outs"
1160,Could be a lot better,Getting better
1161,I am not able to work due to health problems. My husband not being able to get the job he is qualified for at the proper pay rate and he also has health problems that was delayed due to lack of good doctors in our area.,"Right now I think that we have to many immigrants who should not be here and also are getting more money than they should. They should be paying their own way or stay and fight in their own country. Many them come here with prejudice and racist attitudes that we don't want in Canada. Any one is welcome but you need to abide by our laws and not change our culture, like many others have come and respected the Canadian way by continuing to keep some of the culture. I believe that the Muslim Mosque is recruiting people to destroy our values and teach to kill those that oppose."
1162,Paycheck to paycheck,I'm torn
1163,okay,It has to stop. We as tax payers should not be paying for them - giving them benefits and social services that they have never contributed to
1164,Stressed,
1165,I am on OAS and CPP - make do but have nothing left over for saving or any extras,I think immigration is a good thing but needs more controls
1166,I feel ok with my personal financial situation.,I feel good about immigration to Canada.
1167,"I am waiting very patiently for the Basic Income Program to arrive. Until then, I can barely stay afloat.","I believe that immigration should divert people to less populated places in Canada. Such as Timmins, Sault Ste Marie...

Not to the inner sanctum like the GTA."
1168,It's good but can always be better. I think we get paid very little yet everything is extremely expensive!,I'm an immigrant so I feel good

1170,"I feel personally our household is bringing in a healthy income, but this is due to working hard and not necessarily government assistance","I think it is a good thing to bring in immigrants, but should be done through the proper channels and ensure that our own population is also being taken care of"

1172,Dreadful,I feel very positive about immigration to Canada.
1173,Could be better,Good that is how we built Canada
1174,Bad,The rules must be kept the same for ALL immigrants. (They are NOT)
1175,My financial situation is very good. I worked hard and saving was my priority,"Now that the US is more strict, Canada seems to have an open door. We are not first country that this refugees entered so they should not be coming to us."
1176,Making almost enough to pay my bills,"Getting worse, not helping the Canadian people, we don't need to pay for refugees when they are thinking that we have to pay to them for everything and they disrespect us (I have real and true example when attack the neighbours)."
1177,,
1178,,
1179,When minimum wage was increased everything else went up but my wages,I feel they are changing our country for the worse. When they come to Canada they should honour our customs
1180,Very tough to get job. Not easy to live with family. Living cost high.,Some immigrants are doing good and giving whole contribution towards the country
1181,Coping,Too many immigrants already
1182,Could be doing better,I think it's a good thing if they are productive members of society

1196,,
1197,,There are too many immigrants right now.
1198,Ok. Taxes are very high.,Too many immigrants.
1199,We are retired and living comfortably.,There are too many. They're taking away jobs from Canadians. They are taking away benefits from Canadians and raising our taxes.
1200,It's ok but based on changes made by the government I may not retire as early as originally planned,Screen people better and don't make it a free ride. People need to also earn the privilege like they did a century ago. Help to get on your feet is good but they get more help than people who already live here do sometimes. And they should be Canadian. Don't take my culture away because if I went to their countries I would have to abide by their culture and laws and probably would not get a huge amount of assistance.  If it is too easy everyone just shows up and takes and takes
1201,Right now I am looking for work and trying to stay hopeful,Mixed
1202,Stayed the same,It's ok  if some people immigrated here in Canada
1203,Making a transition for my husband and I from working full time to retiring.,Immigrants view Canada as a safe place for providing an improved life for families.  Immigrants should be wiling to work to provide for their family in order to get the wages and benefits afforded other Canadians.
1204,Just enough to get by,We need quality immigrants to keep the economy going
1205,NA,There are far too many free services available to immigrants today. My parents arrived here with zero dollars in their pockets and didn't speak the language. They needed to work very hard and they conformed to the societal culture and didn't accept any assistance. They managed well and were grateful.
1206,Not quite dismal but certain to struggle in the next 2 years,Getting ridiculous. Soon we will end up being divided like the u's
1207,I'm living month to month with no chance of saving anything,I'm fine with it as long as they do not get special treatment like medical coverage and pensions. They should have to work at least 5 years before getting coverage and pensions
1208,Living month to month,Ralph Goodale and his team do a good job of screening immigrants so Canada can benefit from those selected
1209,,
1210,Good,Positive
1211,I manage okay on my pensions,Canada needs immigrants to sustain the economy
1212,I live paycheque to paycheque.,"I think it is amazing that Canada is open to bringing in people that have had the misfortune of being born in a place with less freedom/opportunities. Although, once here I think that we should only help them get a job, and then they should be on their own to pay for food, housing, etc. like the rest of us."
1213,I am sick of working hard and having to pay taxes where the government takes more then I get . Then they waste it,Protect our borders. Stop bringing in more people and expecting tax payers to pay for it
1214,Fairly good.,Good.
1215,Wife lost job due to recent raises in minimum wages,Too easy. The ones that come here and try to do things honestly pay a large sum to bring their families to Canada. Imagine having medical tests yearly on young children and it takes 5 years to get through the red tape. That is unacceptable
1216,I feel ok - I work hard to make my living. It's not easy,I think there's been too much emphasis put on making sure the immigrants are well compensated when the rest of us have to work relentlessly.  Just because we didn't immigrate doesn't mean we're not in a difficult situation.  My father immigrated here and wasn't given a penny and worked hard to make a living.  Tired of me working to pay others to sit around
1217,Bad,Enough people
1218,I am making enough to get by. It should be much better.,We should not be paying for others when Canadians are already suffering.
1219,Satisfied,Good

You never know when a job loss is around the corner or something else comes up that we don't have the money for,"I feel like everybody needs to go somewhere Canada to welcome and Country so why wouldn't they come here. But I don't feel they should be able to take our jobs, they should have to find their own way, and make their own... I don't know... but they should have to find something that doesn't take away from the people already here."
1227,"I have a lot of student debt, and can't afford a car and am barely able to save for a home.",Good thing
1228,So-so,Should be closely monitored
1229,It sucks,
1230,We are comfortable but can't be extravagant.,"As an immigrant myself, I know our family worked hard and were not dependent on a dime from any of the governments. We made it just fine. It's ridiculous for immigrants to expect everything on arriving in Canada. We had to make arrangements through a consul and on arrival (mom, dad & 4 young kids) had a place to live and my dad had a job waiting.  What's wrong with this country? Before coming here, can't people get in touch with assistance before they arrive?"
1231,It's bad. We already have a low income and rising hydro prices and gas prices are not helping.,"Being an immigrant, I approve."
1232,It's okay,

1241,Getting by,Good for the country overall
1242,Happy.,There should be less immigrants.
1243,"Ok. Both my kids graduated from university, that's a good enough accomplishment",We need more young people because of our aging population
1244,"Being retired and on a fixed income, the Provincial Government increasing taxes in various areas and disposing of Provincial assets, I know it is getting worse.","After World War 2, Immigrants and Refugees had to spend at least one year working on a farm before going into the cities and I feel that this program should be reintroduced."
1245,I'm a student.,I'm an immigrant.
1246,I feel comfortable and satisfied with my personal financial situation.,"I think that we should promote immigration, however we need to focus on people who can fill vacancies that currently exist to ensure that they are not unemployed or underemployed when the arrive [i.e. doctors who are unable to practice because their credentials aren't recognized]."
1247,,
1248,Manageable,Good deeds
1249,Getting better thanks to hard work,We let those who leech of society in and qualified people don't get in
1250,I would like to be earning more money and pay less taxes and be able to put more money in my retirement fund so that I could retire sooner .,I feel that immigration is good for Canada but there should certain requirements that the immigrants should adhere to such as what type of skills they have to offer Canada.
1251,Not going anywhere. Just making it.,
1252,Very tide,Not that good
1253,"Good, but worried about cost of child care down the line",Gives others a chance to lead a better life.
1254,,
1255,Getting worse with every new tax increase.,Put them where they have room and a need.
1256,It's a mess,There is too much immigration into Canada
1257,It's very sturdy,Everyone is so worried about nothing. In reality it's just lazy Canadians looking for a scapegoat
1258,Fine,Fine
1259,Very comfortable,Maintain our standards for entry
1260,"Could be better, could be worse.","It is a kind thing to do, and the right thing to do, but follow the process, don't just show up with all your belongings."
1261,Doing ok,No opinion
1262,I am living comfortably with my financial situation. I have money saved up in case of an emergency and don't see any real financial problems in the foreseeable future.,They should not let too many immigrants into Canada. They are taking away jobs that Canadians could possibly have.
1263,OK,"Since I am an immigrant, I am for it. Immigrants helped build this country to what it is today."
1264,Comfortable but just hanging on,Come and be Canadian even - Canadian
1265,,
1266,Its not bad as my wife still works a bit and we rent out a apartment in our home and that pays taxes and energy,"If done the proper way that's good, border jumping is NOT good"
1267,Living ok can pay the bills with something left over,If the right people come with skills
1268,Getting worse,Good for country
1269,Okay,It needs to increase
1270,Satisfied and confident it will improve,"It is excessive, unnecessary, and unchecked"
1271,,
1272,"I am extremely comfortable as I save much more than I spend and don't have many large expenses (no car, don't have/want kids, no debt). Obviously, I would prefer to be rich and retired, but I am in no danger of starving.","Immigrants often do jobs born-Canadians refuse to do. They often work much harder too. I'm all for immigration, especially since population dynamics are pointing toward issues with funding our social programs and declining working-age numbers."
1273,SURVIVABLE BUT SHOULD BE BETTER,IMMIGRATION IN CANADA CAN BE A GOOD THING
1274,Need to be more stable now that we have a son to raise. Very hard to get ahead significantly. Can't plan for retirement and my son's education - one or the other and he comes first.,Accepting immigrants is a responsibility that Canada should be proud of. I feel immigrants add a cultural depth to our country and enhance the depth of our national diversity.
1275,Struggling,Nothing
1276,"Scared, hard to get things for us",Hard to say
1277,"At ease, comfortable but not complacent","I was born in Greece and consider myself an excellent all-around, loving, giving Canadian (Nova Scotian)"
1278,It is not getting better because many items are going up in price and is depleting any expendable income,"Immigration is a good thing handled properly - it needs to be balanced with immigrants that can work and refugees, 

but no border jumpers - period. They are displacing others who have been waiting for years"
1279,Taxed to death,Our federal government has made a joke of the immigration process
1280,It's ok,It's good
1281,"At present it is stable, however, I feel that within the next several years my situation will change for the better.","I agree with Canada's immigration system, however, there are Canadian families who have no jobs or lost their jobs due to downsizing. Canada should have a policy of re-training for these personnel to help them get back into the workforce ASAP. Money spent on some of the immigration policies could be better spent on jobs for Canadians, helping seniors on fixed incomes and lower taxes."
1282,Stable,More emphasis on quality immigrants and allow their qualifications temporary equal status
1283,,Immigration is OK but illegal immigration is out of control
1284,Hopeless,Send them back to their country

1286,"Comfortably retired, able to travel extensively, no financial concerns","We are a nation of immigrants.  If we were willing to contribute more through taxes, then we would be able to better care for all Canadians."

1291,,
1292,"I would be happy with the amount I make now that minimum wage has gone up. However, all the businesses cut hours and raised prices so the wage increase has not made much difference.",Canada is a multicultural country. Our society is built on this idea.
1293,Coping,Generally in favour provided people are vetted properly
1294,,
1295,"It's a bit of a struggle keeping things as they were. Prices going up, gasoline, etc. ",It's gotten excessive with purge in Quebec
1296,"As a single living pensioner who worked all my life in the province of Ontario, I am presently hoping to get support through Niagara Regional Housing for subsidized housing.  It's pathetic",Out of control
1297,Needs to improve,Allowing immigrants into Canada is the decent thing to do but there cannot be unlimited immigration.
1298,It's not getting any better,They should cut back on it
1299,Taxed too much,Fit in or fuck off!
1300,Great,We need it
1301,Comfortable but not due to current government,Too many economic refugees are getting in
1302,,
1303,Okay,Keep as is
1304,,
1305,Government doesn't seem to be liking its people to save money,"It is very difficult to get residency in Canada, it should be made easier."
1306,I am coping,If they are legally here all is good
1307,It is stable.,Immigration is a waste of tax dollars.
1308,I make enough to survive.,We're doing enough. We need to help local people first before others from other countries. To many homeless asking for money and struggling to survive that are already Canadians.
1309,Adequate however no advancement,"Too many coming in to be supported by Canadians. More checks should be done and no one with criminal record should be admitted and if found, immediately deported"

1312,,
1313,Could be better,I have no problem with it
1314,Living paycheck to paycheck with no personal extra income,They have so many people on government assistance they should help them get an education
1315,Good,Ok

1317,"Well, its not very good right now. I don't know why.","I don't feel any ways about it, lol cool"
1318,,
1319,Everything has gotten more expensive,The processing should be more expedient
1320,Anxious,Fine
1321,Cannot meet current obligations due to unplanned health issues,More scrutiny should be applied so as to reduce reliance on support and benefit programs
1322,Coping but having to run a small business in order to do it.,
1323,It can always be better but I am not complaining,Canada is an immigrant country so everyone should be welcome
1324,,
1325,"It is getting better, but I would like to be doing better than living from paycheck to paycheck","As for housing for example, it should be that you look after the homeless that is here now first then worry about the refugees"

1327,I am financially stable,It has an overall good impact
1328,It needs to get better.,It should be regulated better.

1330,My ex wife does not work and she has zero reason or incentive to work because government polices allow her to live off my hard earned salary without any reason to lift a finger. Criminal!!!!,Certain countries with high percentage of criminal activities  should be limited compared to higher educated countries.

1334,,
1335,,
1336,Comfortable,Too many immigrants all together. We should be focusing on all Canadians first before others.
1337,Worried about the future as O.A.P. have not even been mentioned much by the political leaders.,"Immigrants are what made this country great, but the immigrants of the past are the old people of today and are looked upon as a burden and not as the resource they once were. Canada pension is not a charity. It was paid for by the workers and the employers and should be out of reach of greedy government who treat it like a ponzi scheme...

























"
1338,,
1339,"not bad, living very well","Need many more people coming in legally. Canada population is too small for the size of this country. More people, less cost for all."
1340,Could be better,"Too much money spent on immigration, not enough on our own seniors and Canadians"
1341,OK,OK
1342,I'm concerned about growing old past retirement.,I welcome our diversity yet we still must be careful in how it is managed.
1343,Not looking rosy at all!,"We all came from immigrants, let's be real"
1344,Day to day,I'm ok with it
1345,Bad,Less
1346,Not good,"While immigration is good, there has to be a limit. The city has more population than it can handle. This is leading to more congestion, higher house prices and higher price for consumer goods."
1347,,
1348,,We or our ancestors immigrated from somewhere down the line.
1349,Good,"Many of them disrespect the ""Canadian"" culture and just do whatever they feel, as if they are still living in their own country."

1352,It's good,I don't know
1353,"Well I'm on disability and they don't pay enough to live on a month. I went on the basic pilot program so let's see if this is better. They should raise the Ontario disability, you only get 1100 a month to live, pay rent, buy food and pay your hydro, gas, water, telephone and cable. How do you live on that a month? You can't. It sucks. If you raise minimum wage, you should raise Ontario disability and old age pension and CPP.",It seems they get more money to live here when they come. The people that live in Canada get less
1354,Senior pensions could be higher,"We should help those people, especially women and children"
1355,I'm lucky my parents are still helping me with some bills.,It's a good thing.
1356,"Expenses keep going up but salary stays the same. Getting harder to stay ahead, not possible to save for retirement, nothing left",Too many people coming in...taking away too many resources
1357,,
1358,I struggle to get by,I think it's essential to help out other humans despite borders.
1359,There won't be any family vacations.,It will never change but I do believe we have millions of Canadians in need of the benefits we offer immigrants.
1360,Needs to be improved,It is a great thing to give people second chances and a better life.
1361,We struggle to get by daily,I believe that they take our jobs and they live better than us. Most have money from their home countries and don't need ours but take it anyways
1362,Very uncertain -job can be lost any day & it's hard to find another,
1363,Fine. Not a big deal.,It's much better than most other countries.
1364,It could be better.,It benefits Canada over the long term.
1365,Not well,
1366,Comfortable how it is,It is a good thing
1367,It is ok but sometimes it is bad in certain months,"I think it is good because it keeps the population up, as long as we are careful of who we let into our country"
1368,I do not like the interest rates going up,Too many immigrants
1369,I am comfortable,Strengthens economy
1370,It's hard but I'm overcoming it,I don't like Indian people
1371,Barely adequate,Should assist current residents more before aiding immigrants
1372,"I was laid off in 2016 and have been unable to find a suitable job, making my financial situation strained.",Immigration is needed.  It is also important to take a number of refugees each year.
1373,Could be better,Canada need immigrants but should be particular on their ability to find work as well.
1374,Desperately trying to stay alive,It can help but at times it takes jobs away from Canadians
1375,Just back to work after maternity leave.  So it's about to get better.  But we are good!,
1376,I am receiving my pension so most things the government does will not affect my life much. I already get a discount on my hydro.,"Canada needs to slow down immigration levels and only allow people in who are actual refugees. There have been several thousand people that have just walked across the Canadian border this year and claim to be refugees. They get housing , health care, etc. while they wait for their cases to be heard. We should look after Canadians first ."
1377,Taxes and rate of interest of mortgage loan has became too much. Poor financial situation,Do not allow illegal refugees
1378,Not too good.,"We are all immigrants, doesn't matter if you were born here."
1379,Bad,Nothing
1380,It could get better,It needs to be more considerate to immigrants
1381,Terrible,Stricter rules should be applied.
1382,,
1383,It's not enough to pay our bills.,I feel Canada needs to take care of who is already here before bringing more in.
1384,Having to pay income tax on C.P.P. benefits is a hardship,"I feel immigration is good for Canada. I do not agree with over populating cities (like Toronto) that has housing issues and employment issues. I also do not agree that we pay for social services (housing, medical, etc.) They need to come to Canada prepared to work hard and pay taxes, and work towards Canadian Citizenship"
1385,"It's fine, middle class","There is too much of an influx of immigrants; Canada feels like a different country now;  our way of life is being changed to accommodate everyone else's cultures & traditions;  grocery stores are carrying all kinds of foods that were never on the shelves before, making less room for brands we have known & used;  clothing styles are changing; I worry about more kidnappings and the inability to find the children due to them being swathed in scarves hiding their faces;  safety on the roads due to women driving with their faces almost completely covered (adequate peripheral vision?); stores carrying cheap merchandise because immigrants have that mindset"
1386,Nervous,Scared
1387,,
1388,na,"Need to have educated, healthy, sponsored (so they are not a burden to Canadian tax payers)"
1389,I wish I had less debt,I think it is good for the economy
1390,Very good,"What Trudeau is doing, terrible. Our Vet, seniors, etc. need help first. You don't bring people in and pay them big bucks for doing nothing but complaining. Let them go back to were they came from. The are freeloading."
1391,Excellent,Too many
1392,I earn enough to live without debts,It's ok

1400,,
1401,,
1402,It is okay at this time.,I feel that there should be more immigrants allowed to come to Canada.
1403,I am broke and in debt at age 25,I feel like our homeless should be helped before others
1404,Hoping it improves in the next few years,Too many people are immigrating to Canada and reaping benefits that people who have lived and worked their whole lives here have contributed to. They want special rules and don't want to follow Canadian rules.  If you don't like our laws don't move here
1405,I am ok with it but I would like it to be better.,I am an immigrant so I will think immigration do the job .
1406,On odsp at 29 makes me feel no security financially for my future and not being able to help take care of my family in the future due to that.,It can be both a great and horrible thing all at once but we shouldn't live in fear and punish the innocent who are only trying to have a better life. A lot of experiences immigrants have gone through are unfathomable to most Canadians.
1407,It is good.,I believe we need immigrants to do jobs for which there are not enough trained Canadians and jobs that Canadians will not do.
1408,Frustrated,Whoever comes to Canada should comply with our laws

1413,I feel like me and my family are trying to cope with it everyday and I hope it gets better in the near future,"As an immigrant, I personally feel really grateful to be here because I lived in a refugee camp almost all of my childhood but being an immigrant is really hard and I think the government should definitely do more to help immigrants"
1414,Will get better once I am more established in my career.,Positive
1415,,
1416,,
1417,We are living pay cheque to pay cheque because I lost job opportunities due to becoming disabled. Years of fighting for the money I deserve has put a strain on our income.,"We are LAND OF THE FREE, so why should we deny anyone seeking refuge?! Too many racist and ignorant people making or trying to make the decision to keep immigrants out and not enough people having the true Canadian attitude. We embrace all and that's how it should always be!"

1419,,
1420,Comfortable,
1421,Okay,It's good for the economy
1422,Pay check to pay check,"Bias, they welcome refugee and give them all they need but their own people are suffering due to a lot of refugee coming in and the government funds them coming from the pockets of its own people. They take away some of the benefits of its own people to give to them while those on the middle to lower level class of life stay where they are because our economy is getting worse due to more and more refugees are coming in that the government needs to support instead of its people."
1423,We are ok but would be compromised if my husband lost his job (and I am unable to work),System is back logged and it would be great if companies followed Dyson Manufacturing example and how they helped the Syrian folks
1424,,Helping build the country
1425,Not feeling good about my financial situation,Should not be allowed into Canada. Have to look after our own people before they take them into Canada

1428,Not great,We are a multicultural country
1429,,
1430,,
1431,,"There a lot of Canadians in need too, they're helping others before they help their own. If the roles were reversed would we get the same treatment, roof over our head, jobs for our family, and a bank account with money? I doubt it"

1433,,It's ok
1434,Okay,Fine
1435,,
1436,,
1437,Scared for the future,"We have enough immigrants. We cannot take care of our own right now. There is not enough affordable housing, health care has wait times that are outrageous never mind having to be almost have a foot in the grave before being able to get a joint replacement.  School system is shot.  Colleges and universities are not producing qualified people as they don't fail students for fear of lack of enrolment. I could go on forever. When do Canadians actually get a break? Why do immigrants get more than what you are willing to offer Canadians? Before immigrants get all the perks, they should be here long enough to be citizens and become citizens."
1438,Hopeless,"I feel that it is positive, but I also feel that it has contributed to overpopulation and lack of housing in big cities such as Toronto."
1439,I am not happy with my situation,I have no problem with it
1440,"I AM NOW RETIRED AND ON PENSIONS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WORK. HOWEVER, EVERYTHING HAS GONE UP THIS YEAR FROM RENT AND UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, FOOD ESPECIALLY, DRUG COSTS, PHONE, INTERNET. I CANCELLED T.V.

THERE IS AN ALMOST EXPLODING PROBLEM WITH THE SOON TO BE RETIRED AND OLDER POPULATION WHO WILL NEED FUNDING SUPPORT. THERE JUST IS NOT A BABY BOOM TO HELP WITH FUNDS IN THE FUTURE SO WE NEED TO LOOK TO IMMIGRANTS TO HELP.
1441,Terrible. We are just barely getting by.,They should stay in their own damn country. We don't have enough money to support our own but will gladly bring in a bunch of terrorists? Because that's logical :(
1442,Using up savings to cover my living expenses due to health issues because too hard to get other financial support or medical help in a timely manner.,

1445,Limitations from disability keeps me in poverty,Welcome all newcomers
1446,"Currently stable, could be better.",I don't know much about it. I think immigration is a good thing because diversity is a good thing.
1447,We never have enough to make it through the entire month,"If they come in legally with proper papers and identification , I do not have a problem. But when they sneak across the border from the US then they should be sent back to the US and let them deal with them"

1456,,
1457,I feel awful that I can not pay my bills,Let some one else take care of them. We need to concentrate on our people first
1458,Not very good. Need to down pay debts,Do not like it. Too much crime from gangs from other countries that continue here and getting free assistance and jobs when seniors need help for housing and home care
1459,I feel OK. Of course would like more for retirement,We should always do what we can.
1460,Okay,Open to all
1461,,
1462,Worried,"Everyone deserves a chance at a good life. However, as a third generation Canadian, who's great grandparents were a part of the first wave of immigrants to arrive in order to try to populate Canada, they were promised a better future for their themselves, their children, and their children's children, etc. I doubt any of them would be very happy to know that 100 years later, nothing they did would be of any benefits to their great great grandchildren, that many of the government grants, supports, etc. would not even be available to their great grandchildren, that instead people who have just simply landed in Canada this year would have more supports available to them then the people who have a long history in Canada with over 100 years worth of tax paying under their belts. Put their lives on the line for their country in WW1  and WW2, suffering mental, physical and emotional wounds that will never heal just so that 80-50 years later, other people who just landed in Canada can benefit from their great sacrifices more than their own great grandchildren. How wonderful for the Canadians that are third generation or  higher to get shunned in favour of someone who has been here an entire five years and hasn't put the work into this country that others have. Yet, all these wonderful grants and start up supports like business start grants are only available to minorities. Just one of many examples of the government catering to immigrants far more than Canadians who have been here a long time. Gee, would be nice to get the same access to start up supports so that I too, can take a stab at having a good life. Unfortunately, no such luck. Do you think that in other countries the landed immigrants get way more opportunities than the long time residents? Hell no. Canada needs to focus on their own first, there's a lot of examples of immigrants taking advantage of us a as an opportunity for easy money. So opportunists just slide on in and milk the system dry and then we suffer."
1463,,
1464,,
1465,It's okay,Okay
1466,,Mostly good
1467,It could be better,"I'm for it if they need to come because of war, famine & etc."
1468,"Could be better, less taxes","Should be stricter laws. If an individual would contribute and better our country, allow them in. Stop bringing in those who drain our system and do not contribute to our economy"
1469,My financial situation is better even though I have less income. I have learned to create a good budget and track my spending carefully and this has helped me improve my personal financial situation.,Immigration to Canada is great for making an improvement to our government. Only if they become criminals and create problems then we need to get rid of them. This way we have the good immigrants trying to help our economy grow.
1470,Looking to find a good job,Positive about it
1471,Not very good,We are already over populated and do not have the funds to support more people
1472,,
1473,Not good,

1481,Living on basic needs,I feel we help too much. We have Canadians that need help right here in our country
1482,Stressed,Unfair
1483,Not very optimistic.,It's good to accept people.
1484,Stressfully coping,Happy to help but there is a limit. Let's help Canadians too
1485,Can't afford to live in GTA anymore. Our home prices are ridiculous. We pay too much income and at the retail level. Sales tax in the US is usually 4% in most states. Housing is 1/4 the price of ours. Our dollar is undervalued.,I support immigration as long as it is fair for Indigenous Canadians. Many of my family members are immigrants.
1486,Going from bad to worse. This is not a country for the mentally ill or disabled,"We need to stop relaxing our immigration laws or we are going to end up like American. They are not an example to follow. Australia is a good example, very intolerant laws of immigration"
1487,Stable,Way out of line.
1488,Not very good,I feel like it's a good thing. But I feel like Canada should be overall fair with everyone - equal
1489,Annoyed,We are equal regardless of our status
1490,,Take care of those already here before you bring in more
1491,,
1492,I struggle to make ends meet and I lose sleep over how to better provide for my family.,We have an obligation to society and mankind to help one another. The scope of how much we can do is the issue. It has to be enough but also can't take away from current Canadians that are living in poverty.

1494,Good but could be better,Needs to be limited. They seem to matter more the born Canadians
1495,"We eat soup at least 4-5 times a week. And dumpster diving is out. We try to eat well on weekends. We have great friends next door. Our nephew works for a farmer, he gives us food when he can. We have a huge mortgage and we live in a dump, we can't afford to fix it up. And medications are out of this world and more and medications are coming off the ODB list therefore you pay the full price.  I think our government is biased against older people. Well a lot of people are ignorant of us (even these surveys we do for a little extra money, you don't fit the demographic). Hell we have been through all of them. They can raise the pay of the teens to 15 bucks an hour, give a murderer 10.1 million to a murderer all because he got beat up, he is alive the other guy is not. I think he should have murderer on his forehead. Oh yeah give all the kiddy-poos free meds.  I think they're just waiting for us to die. If this is democracy it stinks. I learned in school double taxation was illegal. We are taxed up the wazoo. Equality we ain't got.  And Winney-poo as she is known to the unwashed peons. If she worked for a company she would be fired.  I think the government is an old boys club, they get too many perks. Winney-poo and Trump should be sent to Iraq for target practice, that's what my hubby says. Sorry about the few words. I could still go on.","I am a British immigrant. We did not get anything but piece of paper, and we have been scratching in the dirt ever since. These immigrants should be investigated through a microscope. I know this sounds harsh and I was a nurse, they let people in with diseases that drains the economy. Everyone on welfare should have to work like shoveling snow in places that do not get shoveled. I'm sorry but I think welfare breeds welfare. There is one fat chick who thinks it's funny, then goes to Disney world every winter. I reported her but nothing was done. I think this country needs a good shake up."
1496,"I'm managing, but taxes and Hydro bills are killing me and have had to cut back on food and clothing in the last few months","Considering I'm a mixed-race child of immigrant parents, I feel pretty darned positive about immigration!"

And there's so little left in my bank account. I feel hopeless. I wish I could get some money to help me get myself out this problem I created. I feel like a total loser,I wish more people from Asia and Africa and America and more Mexicans and Cubans would immigrate here :))))))
1538,Ok,Typos people need a place to live

ONLY when ALL of them are taken care of - seniors, handicapped, etc. and there is next to NO unemployment in the country can we start thinking about refugees. Skilled trades and highly educated immigrants should be a priority. Sponsorship should be limited only to spouses, kids and parents - that's it."
1543,It's good but could be better,We should focus on our own citizens first
1544,I was forced to file for personal bankruptcy in May 2017.,"Canada needs to take care of their own people first! Too many immigrants take government money that could and should be allocated to Canadians, such as veterans, seniors, and child care."

1559,"I currently live in Alberta under an equally terrible government, but since I am in the military and I am fiscally responsible and knowledgeable I am doing fine on my steady income.",We have a terrible system with not enough checks and balances. Government is terrible at almost everything it does and this is a real problem especially when it comes to immigration. We must only accept those that offer a benefit to us; as with any other day to day decision we make. Furthermore the laws on the books must be enforced which is not happening under our current feckless and pathetic government.
1560,Would always like to make more money,None
1561,I'm satisfied.,It is quite frankly very 'Canadian'! Which is a positive point.
1562,Had to get a part time job,We need more of it

1575,I want more money,"Trudeau is bringing ""reformed"" Isis members back to Canada. These people not too long ago had guns pointed at this country and our allies and this sick twisted baby we call Prime Minister is letting them into the country. Its disgusting. Immigrants from these Arab and Muslim nations on the whole have very evil and vile beliefs (their religion) you can see the devastation they cause by looking to Europe now. There needs to be major and extensive background checks for all immigrants coming from hostile and bad religions to pick the good from the bad. And if that means they stay in holding communities where they can't leave until they are vetted well that's the price of freedom. I don't care."
1576,,
1577,It could be better,It is good to bring skilled workers in to fill jobs that we cannot fill ourselves
1578,The cost of living is getting higher and higher with loads of bills and taxes with unseen usefulness or benefits; it's not even obvious to get your head above water even with a 100k year salary,Compared to most countries in the world Canada is regarded as a safe haven for immigrants; but still more efforts should be made towards economic and work conditions

1580,Good,Good

1594,"Very bad, the liberal government are a bunch of fools. Now making weed legal to kill off our kids. Stupid fools. I would never vote for them again. And taking in 50 refugees to go on welfare and people here are struggling and living below our means",All these refugees for 20 30 years on welfare and working people can't pay rent. Only Caucasian people from Syria while we are filing for family members for years and get denied.
1595,My personal financial situation is excellent,I think immigration to Canada is great and shows the true spirit of Canada to welcome and help new people in our country.
1596,Personal finance situation is stagnant at the moment and fluctuated at times.,Immigration is a great benefit for the Canadian society as we can benefit from an array of various foreign cultures and expand our country. More screening however needs to be done.

1606,It's okay but could be better,I have no opinion
1607,I pay too much taxes,Too much illegal immigration
1608,My financial situation has plummeted as the start of mid November of 2017. In 2018 I've noticed a dramatic difference on difficulty to catch up on late bills.,I don't agree with how our government is allowing the mass numbers of immigrants to enter. I think it should be difficult like it was 30 years ago. If immigrants want to flee to another country then they should have to fight for it like everyone else regardless of race/religion/ethnicity.

The ""Shelter"" part of my ODSP benefits only covers 63% of my actual rent; and that's just one of many defects in the program.","That Canada should do more for Canadians before offering to support new immigrants.

1678,Scared if we get a fiscally irresponsible party in power like the Liberals have been for 15 years.,"They need better screening techniques and to lessen the number of immigrants allowed yearly in Ontario and Canada. WE need to decrease greatly the number of Muslims allowed in. We will have the same problems Europe have if we keep letting them in. Increased calls for Sharia law, terrorism and ISIS issues."

1680,Not really good,Stop refugees
1681,I get most of my money from my parents right now.,"It's alright, but I would say that groups that come from the same places are likely to stick together."
1682,I am worried that I will not be able to pay my bills,If they are legitimate refugees and are willing to work rather than take welfare they can help the economy
1683,Can't live paycheque to paycheque. It is very difficult,It's fine. Just can't pay for them. They need to work not be spoon fed with government money
1684,Not good,Learn English before immigrating.

Rent takes almost 70% of my income, it's wrong.","They let in too many people who aren't real immigrants, move in Ontario, and many take the jobs of Canadians.

1701,Not great,Diversity is good
1702,I feel that my current financial situation has a lot of room for improvement and I hope it will improve in the future.,I feel diversity is a strong part of Canada as a country and immigration is important to maintaining that diversity. Immigration brings in skilled immigrants and is better for Canada overall.
1703,Stressful,It's too easy
1704,Getting worse and if interest rate rises will be too bad for my family with no appropriate increase in salaries being paid by our employers,"Please stop the refugees being taken in. Now this country Canada is becoming another India with beggars at every corner. Do not know what difference between my home country India and my present home Canada when I see the Syrians begging.  Stop the refugees entering through US, Canada cannot accommodate all, it will lead to less care and more hardship for us Canadians"
1705,I'm completely satisfied and content with my current financial situation,It's a great way to expand culture in Canada
1706,I'm on assistance and I don't make that much on my own,"They aren't helping. They are hindering, straining  the system for Canadians. Keep more out"
1707,Worse than before.,We need less of it. Encourage Canadians to have more children.
1708,"I personally do not have many expenses other than rent, so all money that I make is mine to keep. That said, I feel very comfortable with my financial situation.","It can be a good thing, but it can easily become a bad thing.

1712,It's ok I guess,It doesn't bother me
1713,It's getting better compared to last year at this time.,It's a good thing.
1714,Very tough for a single person with no kids to maintain a house.  No tax credits available as only families get them.,Legal immigrants are welcome as they add value to the country.  Immigrants who choose to bypass the system in place should not be allowed unless they follow the rules.
1715,Due to my mental health I'm on Ontario works for the time being,Can't say much on the subject
1716,It's ok but making just over minimum wage so have to budget well,I think immigration is currently fine just the way it is.
1717,Not stable enough to make me know all my expenses are covered. Unable to keep any savings or invest in anything.,I believe all immigrants should have to abide by the rules equally. Letting people fast track to become citizens is unfair because the rest have to wait and pay money.
1718,"The house market crashed, my car was stolen, hydro prices are up, the government is always one step behind.","Canada is like America. This land was stolen from natives. Honestly we are all immigrants in the new world. Anyone who crosses an entire ocean to come here wants to lead a better life. The more people come the larger our GDP, taxes collected and more entrepreneurs and skilled workers are introduced to the country. The more I travel and meet people the more I realize we are all the same"
1719,Not satisfied with it right now at this point in my life,No thoughts
1720,I am having a hard time paying all my bills.,I think we should help people who are at the risk of being hurt or killed.  If we can help we should.
1721,I feel we are coping but need to save for the kids secondary education,"It is right for the country. Except allowing Syrians etc. that have nothing to offer the country. No money, no place to live, no sponsors. So who supports them? Us, the tax payer"

1731,My financial situation has gotten better only because I have received a raise and I have adjusted some things with my bank. But it has not become better after that. The government keeps taking more.,"Immigration is fine. Too many are given a free ride when they arrive.

1743,Poor,Too much immigration
1744,My husband lost his job last year and has been having a really hard time finding another one. He is over 50 and companies are reluctant to hire him thinking he will be retiring soon but we are so not there yet. Unemployment ran out after only 7 months and now we are living on savings which won't last long. We still have a daughter in university and another son living at home who can't afford to move out because prices are incredibly high. I was a stay at home parent and am now looking for a job but after being out of the work force for so long it's hard to find a job that doesn't want me to work crazy hours. Very hard to do those hours when you aren't used to them.,I think we need to put a stop to it for some time. I think we need to stop bending over backwards for them and making them feel comfortable and welcome and start helping our own first! They need to adapt to our ways not the other way around. Canada is not as friendly as it used to be. They buy a house and 3 families live in it and pay the same amount of taxes I do. Every house that now gets sold in my neighbourhood has a basement apartment added to it. When I go downtown Toronto all you see is homeless people but there are some new immigrants from Syria living in hotels nice and comfortable.

1771,,
1772,,
1773,Too much taxes are taken,It's getting too much
1774,We manage to pay for our bills. But extras are out of the question.,It's essential and newcomers contribute to our country in many ways.
1775,,
1776,Needing extra income,Contribute to the economy
1777,Help,
1778,Fine. No strong feelings.,"Immigration is required to maintain population. Immigration provides a positive impact on the economy, improves culture, etc."
1779,struggling,good
1780,getting worse,"It's not right. It is too hard to come as a visitor or permanent resident here, and hard to connect with family members. Illegal immigrants are benefiting more in this country"
1781,,
1782,,
1783,So-so,
1784,Ok,Limit to educated immigrants
1785,I get by and have money to put into my retirement fund.,"I understand it is necessary to allow in immigrants because people like me have chosen not to have children so for us people not reproducing, immigrants are required."
1786,Scared,It is too liberal. And too often immigrants are given rights like free prescriptions and university that actual citizens do not have.
1787,I am worried for my retirement,N/A
1788,,
1789,Na,"Too many asylums now a days. This is actually causing changes in culture which is not at all good. If you see in Toronto, lot of incidents in the last few weeks. These never happened before."
1790,,
1791,good,not good
1792,comfortable,positively
1793,,
1794,,
1795,Could be better. Wish I made more or had lower taxes and bills so I could keep more of my money.,No strong feelings
1796,It could be better,not good
1797,Trying to pay debts.,It's a good opportunity for people in other countries to have a better life.
1798,,
1799,will be improving,too lenient and accepting.
1800,Not good,No comment
1801,,
1802,,
1803,Horrible,I am a child of immigrants
1804,"Comfortable, however pay way too much for childcare",Neutral
1805,I feel that my financial situation is stable,it's good
1806,"Lost job after 23 years & went back to school, was disappointed that financial assistance was not available via unemployment insurance","While searching for grant money for either going back to school or opening a new business, there were many opportunities for immigrants but done for single, born in Canada, women"
1807,It's not great,It's fine
1808,I am just comfortable with no extra money to kick around,
1809,"It has definitely improved over the past year or so, but that's because I got better at saving and not splurging on unnecessary items. It doesn't have anything to do with the government.","I am all for helping less advantaged countries but there is such a thing as being ""too"" nice."
1810,Not good,
1811,,
1812,Could be better,Should be more controlled
1813,The tax is very high to save money.,There should be thorough background check.
1814,,
1815,It could be better,Neutral
1816,comfortable,
1817,Will get better with more healthcare worker budget,Important and a Canadian value
1818,na,it's awful
1819,"Not bad, but could be better.",
1820,nothing,It's great
1821,I am a student in university so I am not in the best financial situation. I work part time but struggle to pay for anything other than tuition,
1822,,
1823,It's hard,It's perfectly fine
1824,,
1825,"It's livable, not complaining",No need for more immigration. They are taking jobs away from Canadians and we are all paying for them
1826,Coping sending two kids to university on one income,"it is a benefit bringing skills, workers and diversity to our country"
1827,Minimum wage still does not make up for cost of living. Cost of living went up when minimum wage went up so businesses could account for cost spent on workers,It would be alright but now I can't go anywhere without a Indian being my server when they still don't quite know how to speak English. I spent 3 years trying to get hired and got nothing and these people who hardly speak English have taken the jobs I had applied to. As a customer to the business I want them to know what I'm saying and for me to understand what they are saying.
1828,"Parents on long term disability so making a lot less than before, more struggles",Diversity is good and so is helping others out
1829,,Important to Canadian diversity and growth
1830,"Taxes are too high on everything from hydro, to gas to food. It's tax on top of tax on top of tax. Ask the wealthy to contribute more not the middle-class if you can even say there is a middle class anymore.","It's a complete mess and free for all. European immigrants had to start with NOTHING, no help at all. It was all a help yourself situation. Now immigrants come and get handouts and receive more money supplemented by taxpayers than Indigenous/Aboriginals and Seniors. It is absolutely shameful. Who thought of this? Clearly favouritism."
1831,,
1832,it's fine,
1833,"not too great, mom lost her job because of new selling of alcohol in grocery stores",immigration is good and brings new ideas and culture to Canada
1834,poor,
1835,Na,Too easy to get in here. Given too much when they get here.
1836,,
1837,"As a student working part-time for minimum wage and paying for school and rent, my personal financial situation is poor. But I am lucky to have two working parents who are able to supplement me when needed",Immigration is great for the country and immigrants need to be better appreciated and offered services to have their needs met more efficiently
1838,"I feel like I'm coping with how much I get, could get more",I feel like they aren't Canadian because their terms are different
1839,,
1840,I feel I'm doing better than many people,"We must stop bringing more refugees to this country, we don't have good or enough health or jobs, more people less quality of living for Canadian"
1841,Terrible,
1842,,
1843,"I am on salary making an ok wage, but still living paycheck to paycheck. No savings due to cost of rent. To live somewhere I am proud to show my family the rent is high which does not leave room to save to afford a down payment and buy a house",It's important to grow as a nation
1844,,
1845,"Terrible, been very difficult to save money.",
1846,,
1847,It could be better.,I wish it was better
1848,Hopeless,fairly positive
1849,Living from paycheck to paycheck.,"Helping is one thing but allowing so many in is overwhelming and raises our taxes to give them everything our own Canadian people don't receive. Free housing, education, etc. Take care of our own first!"
1850,Hydro rates and vehicle gas rates are totally out of control,"Immigration is important but funding for them should not fall on the governments shoulders. If they are coming to Canada, their sponsors should be responsible for all expenses incurred or they are to go back to their own country"
1851,,
1852,,
1853,,
1854,I'm comfortable but it cannot be maintained.,Canada did a good job. Canada is built on immigration.
1855,It is good and expected to increase regardless of which party is elected,"As the child of immigrant parents, I think immigration is what makes Canada so great"
1856,,
1857,I cannot get enough money to buy a house. Rents are sky rocketing and the government just keeps spending more than they have coming in. Interest on the debt is 1.1 billion and they don't care that my taxes have to pay for it and it will keep going up the way they keep spending which leaves less money for me. It is really depressing.,"Immigration should be done legally, none of this cross border from the USA. All people crossing should be told they will not be accepted that way...they need to apply through the queue. Also, when there is a war in another country, it doesn't mean that everybody automatically is poor, or that they don't want to go back to their own country. Not enough is being done to see if people are a threat or not. We need immigration because we are not having enough children here, but it needs to be sensibly. Also, I don't want the culture of Canadians to be lost...like Merry Christmas is taboo sometimes now."
1858,I scrape by every month to live,"they get more benefits than we do, which isn't fair"
1859,Student. Need I say more,need more screening
1860,,
1861,"I make ends meet, however do not have extra income at the end of the month for savings.","I welcome it. I think diversity is a strength, however Canada should focus on helping it's own citizens before opening its doors for outsiders."
1862,"Stuck. Rent keeps going up, hydro keeps going up. Food prices are high","They get treated better than our own citizen. They try to change our beliefs but if roles were reversed and we were in their country we'd be expected to adapt

  They should have to adapt or go home."
1863,Poor,Crap
1864,good,
1865,"I am stressed. We are currently paying child support that is double the amount we are suppose to pay. We are currently in court fighting it, but it could take a year more which is stressful. As a result we have no disposable income and we are living on a tight budget.","I think it's fine, but I don't think the government filters them properly. Around the time they were letting an increase of refugees in I saw a bunch of women begging for money. Were they letting them in and not helping them? It was odd."
1866,,
1867,I feel like the every time one government releases a budget our taxes go up.,"Stop it, let us deal with our current population problems first (homelessness, health care...). If we need specific trades then we can let in the best candidate to fill the job"
1868,,I think it's a good thing.
1869,,
1870,,
1871,situation is okay,not sure
1872,unsure,positive
1873,,
1874,,
1875,,
1876,Very depressing that someone with mental and physical illness has to live on such low income.,
1877,Difficult. Having a child with special needs and a husband in full-time school and I myself with physical issues where I can only work part-time make our situation very hard,"Too many have been allowed in. They should take note of how it was done in the 60's and 70's where they were allowed to go to smaller towns and work to ""prove"" themselves and actually work"
1878,I can barely make it.,"If they want to work, let them come!"
1879,,
1880,I live paycheque to paycheque.,We need to support the people who currently reside here before supporting more immigrants.
1881,"stable, positive",it is a positive way to keep our culture progressive
1882,very good,nice
1883,mnbhhjkk,so-so
1884,Doing just fine,"That's what we all are, so positive"
1885,"I wish I was better off, I am struggling",I believe immigration has had a very positive impact on Canada and has brought a lot of culture and new things to Canada
1886,comfortable,fearful
1887,Could be a lot better!,Not sure
1888,,
1889,Satisfied. Would always enjoy more income however I am fine.,Immigration is necessary to grow our economy and maintain our social programs.
1890,"I am on government assistance, and would like to have a job and hope.","For the past 17 years, I have not had a steady job. Some minorities have (pushed, insulted, asked me ""What are you doing here, you are white, you can do better"".  The last place I volunteered at I was told, ""You cannot be trusted, watch her"", Are you talking to yourself again.  Etc.  The assistant manager made sure that anything I did was written down, and reported, she supported the minorities working there.  I ended up almost knocking one woman to the ground.  I wanted to stay there, but they ruined it.  I was there for almost five years."
1891,"From many of the excuses my seeming worth is/has been never more than 25,000 per year then ultimately despite being highly skilled unable to get a job then any job, no decently paid job, very insulting - justifiable hate crime. Apparently though I'm expected to believe that not only is it all my fault, this failure, but the first and most common attack is that I'm crazy and then this ensuing idiocy hardening back to decades age before being apprised of the apparent life altering affliction",No opinion
1892,,
1893,I am struggling. I am living from paycheck to paycheck.,"Canada is a country of immigrants. I do believe, however, that Canada should vet all immigrants entering the country."
1894,"Pretty good because I figure out my 

monthly finances, like rent & bills, etc.... before I go to the bank, so 

this way I know how much money is 

left for rest of month for me","It's a good thing, gives them a chance 

at a better life"
1895,Not bad,We allow too many in without papers
1896,It is getting worse with all the increases in every aspect of living,"Canada first, assimilation first, they left their country for a better life - why do they want to change our country to theirs then? They can have their beliefs but not try and change our beliefs to their beliefs."
1897,I'm retired that's why I don't have too much money,Positively because I'm also an emigrant
1898,,
1899,It is stressful at best but doing the best we can with what we have.,"Immigration reforms need to be looked at very closely, more can be done to keep those people out of the country who should not be here because of crime somewhere else or false applications"
1900,"No overspending, not much travelling, watch our pennies as we are on a pension.","Immigration is fine if you abide by the established rules. But for the present government to allow illegals is terribly wrong.  Do something to protect our borders, change the law."
1901,can manage with what I have but it would be nice to have a little bit more,allow only those individuals who can be of benefit to this country (have the skills that Canadians don't have).
1902,,
1903,Month to month and precarious at best,Needs to be selective and refugees forced to be in communities that need populations and workers
1904,Fine,If they want to live here then go by our rules.
1905,,
1906,Ugh,"Focus on the citizens first. If the citizens were being taken care of more, then my opinion wouldn't be so self-serving, but when immigrants have more benefits than my Canadian-born family (partially native, as well), then it's not a just system."
1907,Stable,Should have more screening
1908,"We have sunk. Every second month, we get a disconnect notice from Hydro. Our bills are outrageous!  We are a month behind in our rent, and our other bills are going unpaid because we just don't have enough to pay them. We're close to being homeless.","I feel that they take too many jobs away.  I'm not against taking in people who genuinely need it, but there's WAY too many who don't. I need it first, and I was born here.  I'm going to be homeless, while NO immigrants are."
1909,HATE IT. WORK PART TIME SHITTY JOB AT 50 CENTS OVER MINIMUM WAGE  WHICH MY UNION GETS AWAY. CANT GET AHEAD NO SAVINGS AND DAUGHTER and a student goes to college next year (probably not university because we cant afford it) so it sure does suck....,everyone has problems....take care of your own country and stop creating more problems by taking immigrants
1910,"I'm now retired, finances are really tight",Immigrants are getting better benefits than a person born and raised in Canada. They have more than seniors born and raised in Canada!
1911,Being on disability and having to pay taxes of over $1000 is not justified.,"Immigration is good - but just letting anyone in is not - Immigrants should have a trade or skill that we need, not become a burden on the tax payers."
1912,,natural
1913,Could be a lot better.,If they are honest and hardworking they are more than welcome to Canada
1914,very comfortable,it is necessary
1915,I'm living on ODSP and it's incredibly difficult to make ends meet.  I often have to limit food just to make other bills,"I feel that if a person has a real conflict with living where they are because of political strife, etc. then they should be given the chance to become a Canadian citizen"
1916,Am retired and on a fixed income that will not increase. Everything else increases. It is difficult and will become more so to buy fresh fruit and veggies let alone meat. It is hard,"Unless you are a member of a First Nations society then all of us or our ancestors are immigrants. Immigrants help make Canada and Ontario the locations they are. Diverse, accepting, innovative. Without them we would stagnate."
1917,hard to save anything as everything keeps going up in price,Immigrants seem to get more than our own seniors or low income Canadians
1918,It is terrible at the moment and no help and living alone,I think there are too many immigrants and it takes away jobs from Canadians
1919,,
1920,Overwhelmingly hard on low income,Taking our jobs
1921,comfortable,alright for the right people
1922,hanging on,stop letting new people in when the government can't provide for the people already here.
1923,Terrible I feel like a sinking ship and am taking drastic steps to try to improve it if I can.,Immigrants and refugees need to be carefully screened to ensure undesirables aren't entering Canada.
1924,it is good,It is good
1925,,
1926,very good,no interest
1927,,
1928,,
1929,,
1930,Retired with adequate investments to see us through,"Immigration is good for any country, but I don't believe we should pay to have immigrants come here. Charity begins at home, we have too many local issues to worry about as opposed to the  rest of the world.  Also if you are immigrating to Canada  be prepared to obey the rules of the country.  It is your new home!!"
1931,"Being retired I am nervous about my future financial situation. If the government can take more control of rent increases, I would feel more optimistic.",It's a humane action to take.
1932,,
1933,Feels ok,Good initiative but biased
1934,"I feel comfortable with my current 

financial situation.",Immigration makes Canada one of the most diverse countries in the world.
1935,declining but hopeful,should take of own citizens first especially those born here
1936,,
1937,Stable,I think there could be some tighter rules for screening
1938,,
1939,Needs improvement,"There is a focus on immigrating massive amounts of certain people's. The wrong families are being brought in, and given great amounts of assistance, while others from countries not placed in the media spotlight are being given so much less."
1940,,
1941,cautiously optimistic,the current policy is fine
1942,DISASTER,"THERE IS LACK OF QUALITY IMMIGRATION, THEY JUST FILL ANNUAL QUOTA"
1943,indifferent,indifferent
1944,Just meet the needs,not carefully select
1945,,
1946,"they are good, but it can go bad",great
1947,Going to get better,It was good before
1948,I'm losing ground every year.,the immigrants should be provided the means to live in rural areas of the country.  They should not stay in the bigger cities.
1949,its okay right now,we can accept less
1950,"Very, very high",Way too easy to get in. The lack of education and skills makes some refugees totally unemployable and a cost to the country.
1951,Could be better,"Indifferent, currently."
1952,,
1953,precarious,The open door policy is ridiculous.
1954,"doing ok, but things could be better",the federal government has opted out of any control over immigration
1955,I am always falling behind as I have made the same wage for 11 years,Immigration should only be allowed on merit to better help the Canadian economy
1956,I need more money.,Too many immigrants.
1957,"I would like to see Hydro 1 rates go down, also gas prices to decrease","Immigration is fine as long as people come in legally. I disagree with what is going on with immigrants crossing from the U.S.A. to Canada, not through the borders but next to them, then they get status as refugee, they should be sent back immediately, this is not the proper way. U.S. is laughing at Canada,"
1958,Income in my retirement age is comfortable,"I and my family immigrated to Canada 50 years ago. I travelled in my life a lot to all continents and I can responsibly say that Canada is one of very few the 

best country in this world"
1959,Very good,Too liberal
1960,I HAVE TO WATCH EVERY BUCK.,LET'S TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN FIRST!
1961,comfortable,too lax
1962,not much left at end of the month,there is a proper process and what's going on is not the proper process
1963,I just have remaining debt to pay and I would be fine,it is good for the country as it grows. We need to accept every ethnic group in order to move forward and to fight discrimination
1964,As long as I can work part time we should be ok,"I came as an immigrant as a small child. My parents had to pass tests, jump hoops and a lot of other requirements to come here, those things should be implemented to those even as refugees."
1965,Comfortable but certainly not rich,It should be widely encouraged but strictly controlled
1966,OK except the price of fuel has to stop going up!,We need to stop giving so much to new immigrants!
1967,so so,
1968,"Could be better, should get rid of some debt",Necessary
1969,Not good,We should not be taking on more people when we already struggle to support a large percentage of Canadians
1970,"I wish it would improve & the Liberal plan for a ""monthly wage"" should be adopted.",Immigration has proven to be an asset to Canada.
1971,"I, like most people, would like to have more money in my pocket.  The price of gas is outrageous given the cost of a barrel of oil.  There are no real tax breaks.  Give with the left hand, take away with the right.",I think we have reached the number of refugees that we should take right now.
1972,,
1973,Hoping that it improves because it can't get much worse.,"Not sure, haven't followed it that closely, but people from war torn countries that need a home should be welcomed."
1974,,
1975,brutal. things have to change!,terrible
1976,"Too much tax for small income earners under $25,000.  There should be no tax withholdings.  Let them have full paycheques.  They need more disposable income.","Mass Muslim immigration can be threatening to Canada's future because of Sharia laws.  We should reduce it and limit its Muslim population to less than 1%.  We should welcome more non-Muslims such as Christians, Buddhists, etc."
1977,,
1978,,
1979,Okay,we are all immigrants in some way
1980,,
1981,I am retired and except for the serious mistakes the Wynne government has made we would be better off,I believe that Canada should help. We should not have an open border and accept all who sneak in the back door. We need to help those who applied and came in the front door. Anyone who circumvents the normal process should be returned from whence they came. We have people already here who have earned the right to be helped.
1982,,
1983,quite satisfied,more vetting needs to be done
1984,,
1985,Content,Proud to live in a country which others want to be part of.
1986,Could get better,The current situation with Syrian refugees panhandling is just the beginning of the problem
1987,could be better,"they are coming taking our jobs, imposing their culture and making our true culture disappear"
1988,I feel my financial position is comfortable,it's a really complicated issue
1989,Tired of the status quo. Tired of making ends meet.,"It's not whether we need immigrants, because we do, but how we let them in."
1990,good,okay
1991,Difficult to see way through each month.,Troubling.
1992,still buying lottery tickets,
1993,I wish I had more money and less debt.,Immigration is important and good when done right
1994,it's tight,"Should decrease specially the international students. 

Too many immigrants....."
1995,Comfortable now,Should be more strict
1996,,
1997,Confident,They should ALL play by the rules and those who come in should not try to change things and ruin our identity which has been badly eroded already
1998,,
1999,"We are in a good financial situation after years of saving, investing and not overindulging. We live comfortably and have recently retired. We hope that we can continue to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.","Immigration is necessary. The Canadian birth rate is dropping. We need to allow immigrants into our country that can contribute to its growth. They should be vetted for security and health purposes and should have a skill, a trade, or offer a professional ability that Canada needs, or plan to establish a business."
2.00E+03,,
2001,At my age -- I hope I don't run out of money from my personal investment account. In a city as expensive as Toronto you can't live with any government pensions.,"Canada should welcome immigrants, because if they are skilled workers they would help the economy. We don't need any freeloaders who are involved in criminal activities."
2002,"It's fairly low, but more stable than in the past.","My parents were immigrants. I have traveled outside Canada, and have met many foreign people who would be an asset to Canada."
2003,too little to live on,must be monitored
2004,If the cost of living continues to grow because of uncontrolled energy and fuel cost I will be forced to sell my home to survive into my eighties. Fuel costs cause a snowball effect for every item as to excessive hydro prices.  It must be controlled.,As long as those who have chosen Canada as their home adapt rather than force change for their sake I have no problem with immigration.  We have a Canadian way of living which should be respected and embraced by new citizens.
2005,It is fine,We should encourage people that will add to the overall well being of the country to come. Immigration should be seen as a way to help the country move forward not as a burden to those that have grown up here and work hard to make ends meet
2006,,
2007,,
2008,Depressed and worried about the future,"Canada needs immigration, we're a big country with few people. They bring new ideas and new foods to Canada."
2009,I feel that I am not the richest but I'm not the poorest,Without immigration Canada would fall.
2010,Living on edge,Dislike
2011,could be better,"I have no problem with it. And from what I have read, Canada needs more immigrants right now."
2012,"I make decent money, doesn't seem to be enough to pay the increasing costs of everything","Immigration builds a country, but there must be laws regulating who gets in and those laws must be followed by all."
2013,bed,real
2014,we get by practising frugality,immigration should be limited
2015,,
2016,"Comfortable, able to pay all bills, eat well and travel on holidays.",Immigration should not be set by quotas to fill job needs in Canada. Each case should be looked at to determine if the person coming in will be an asset to the country and not a drain on present resources.
2017,Comfortable,Necessary
2018,fairly good,do not let them in
2019,,Immigration is one of the reasons Canada is such a special place
2020,Tight,
2021,Stable,
2022,We live pay check to pay check. Doing ok,I am fine with it if the proper screening is done
2023,,
2024,,
2025,,
2026,I feel comfortable,I feel like it's good
2027,it's alright,keep it to a minimum
2028,It is not the best but I am confident it will get better,
2029,struggling,Need to know when to close the doors. The current situation is putting a huge strain on our system
2030,"it sucks my yearly income is under 22,000 and I am a handicapped and retired 66 year Liberal old widow. We need the Liberals to stay so that they can continue to take care of us",there isn't enough screening of the people BEFORE they are allowed into Canada to live
2031,Making it by. Gas prices and hydro are ridiculously priced. Minimum wage has gone up but so has everything else making the higher minimum wage seem not as helpful,"I think it's great we are helping people but we have started to let too many people into our country and therefore seemed to have forgotten about the Canadians who were born here. 



There should be a cap or a budget as to how many refugees Canada can take in and if there already is that is great!"
2032,Starting a new job and not having any finances behind you really sucks. Being the low man on the ladder and everyday living just keeps going up...,We were all immigrants at one time!
2033,good,good thing if it's regulated and people are checked before coming in
2034,For the last 3 years I can't get ahead because I moved and the first two apartments left a lot to be desired. Thankfully I like where I live now but all those extra last month rents and moving expenses really held me back.,Considering that nearly everyone in Canada came from another country or their ancestors did I think it is wrong to condemn the most recent immigrants and it happens every time.
2035,Getting worse,It is OK
2036,comfortable.,too many people. should be limited.
2037,Not good,Don't agree
2038,Poorly,"Very good, because now they're the one making Canada better for those real immigration."
2039,Better than last few years,We need qualified immigrants
2040,Getting better,Good thing
2041,"fairly decent, coping, able to remain stable",
2042,"Retired on an income which doesn't change and bills for electricity, water/sewer, heat, car & house insurance continue to creep up yearly. At some point it will be a hardship. Living in a rural community where house prices are static and buyers are few it is cheaper to be in my home than sell and go elsewhere as elsewhere would be more expensive.","Unless we identify as having First Nations heritage, then we are all immigrants to Canada.

 We are supposed to be the melting pot where everyone gets along. The new immigrants are doing a better job of that than those of us with British heritage and all our we know better than you do how to get along.....not!"
2043,I'm on disability and what I'm given each month is nowhere near enough to live on properly.,I have no feelings either way.
2044,,
2045,Worried about rent increases. Living on pension.,Bring them in. Immigrants enrich us all.
2046,"It's okay but we are currently living from pay check to pay check, no savings at all",It's a big help to a lot of people but the Government should be more careful in taking people in.
2047,,
2048,Difficult to make ends meet,I feel that the rules to immigrate should be the same for all.  That as a country we need stricter rules to ensure the safety of our country.  That those who choose to come to live here need to learn to speak/read the English language and live by Canadian laws.  Laws should not be changed to accommodate those who immigrate here
2049,,
2050,,
2051,I would like to have money at the end of the month to put away in case I need it.,I have applied for numerous jobs but haven't been chosen due the fact that I am not an immigrant
2052,very bad,stop it
2053,na,na
2054,"I am coping, but the government literally wipes people out with the super high taxes they charge, it is completely ridiculous",I feel that immigration has a positive impact overall in general as it brings more talent into the country. But I do not agree with immigrants then going on welfare and not working mooching off of everyone in the work force
2055,Poor,Should be less immigration take care of Canadian first
2056,It's okay,I don't like that we allow so many immigrants in the country
2057,I am comfortable but could use more financially,I think immigration can be a good thing
2058,I do not agree with some things I have to pay for but my financial situation is okay. I just hope things can be easier for people that are ill,More fair than other countries for sure.
2059,Comfortable thanks to my good education to fall back on whatever happens,I believe we should increase skilled immigrants
2060,"Not bad, but could definitely be better.",I support it.
2061,Getting better,I feel immigrants come to our country with their culture and beliefs and we have to conform to their culture/religions but we could never have our own freedoms moving to their country
2062,Stressed,Letting too many in should be caring for our homeless and veterans before immigrants
2063,,
2064,Not too bad.,Necessary
2065,Not good.,Too many people coming into the country. It's a problem.
2066,,
2067,,
2068,,
2069,I find the bills such as Hydro really hurt and even though I am on a pension I still have to pay additional taxes at year end.,I believe people should be free to come to this country if they can work and pay their own way.
2070,"it is a struggle, no treats, purchase my clothes, household items from the Salvation Army and church rummage sales. Eat out impossible","Requirements are not strict enough. Ability to speak either French or preferably English. Good health, no criminal record and most assuredly not kept by our taxes look at the crime rate"
2071,Not good,Canadians should come first
2072,it could be better,it adds to the richness of the country
2073,,
2074,I am only making ends meet.,Immigrants should undergo more thorough screening before admission to Canada.
2075,,
2076,,
2077,,
2078,I feel good about it,I think it was too much too fast
2079,,
2080,can't keep up with rising prices of everything. Prices go up and fixed income stays the same,too easy
2081,feels as if our hard work has been squandered for nothing,"All of us are from other countries - we need to accept immigrants as our families were accepted, aboriginals came over the Bering Sea, most of the rest of us came over the Atlantic."
2082,"I am disabled and on a pension, rents are so very high my budget only allows for 475 for rent, there are no 1 bedrooms in 475 price range, and long waiting list, my cost of living budget is even not enough",no vacancy
2083,"stayed the same, going to worse",for while supposed be stop
2084,Getting by,Everyone here was an immigrant at some time in history
2085,always trying to make it through the month,"word "" terrorist "" comes into my mind immediately"
2086,Not too bad but husband and I have just graduated from school.,Immigration is a good thing. However Justin is not properly screening everyone. Also refugees took up all the hotel rooms in Toronto leaving our homeless citizens on the streets in the cold where they can usually have shelter during the cold months when the shelters are too full.
2087,Struggling with little to no money.,The immigrants should adapt to our ways and not change it.
2088,Good makeup,"I like it, it lets others have a home away from home."
2089,,
2090,,
2091,Not very confident,
2092,I AM QUITE COMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW,"WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN ON LETTING PEOPLE INTO CANADA, WE NEED TO LOOK AFTER OUR OWN UNEMPLOYED AND HOMELESS."
2093,,
2094,not great,
2095,Sad,Excellent
2096,Struggling,
2097,"I have a full time job, however it does not pay a lot and makes it harder to pay bills.",I feel that they are taking jobs and other rights away from us that we would have had in the past.  As Canadians we miss out on other opportunities to be fair.
2098,My personal financial situation is hard because I am a full time student. Unemployed.,"Awesome because my parents are immigrants, my boyfriend's parents are immigrants. Not all immigrants are a certain racial minority. Even Europeans are immigrants."
2099,I need to win the lottery!,It needs to stop.
2100,,
2101,Struggling.,Not needed.
2102,,
2103,,
2104,paycheck to paycheck,only immigrants who will work and take advantage of the welfare and health system
2105,Barely surviving,"People who work are good, not people who sit on disability and take money and housing and healthcare away from Canadian citizens. The hospitals are overcrowded, social housing waiting lists are long, and there are a lot of people with a low level of moral development taking advantage of the Canadian government and tax paying citizens"
2106,I live pay cheque to pay cheque as a mom of two. It's hard to make ends meet when I have to work to survive and pay for child care to be able to do so.,I think we as Canadians should have focused on our veterans and our homeless instead of giving that money and housing to refugees that show no respect for our Canadian culture.
2107,have savings,
2108,Okay,Good but need to screen criminals
2109,"Terrible, because of the dog. All the time just does what he wants.",People should not live in large cities. More than half of the foods are not good for eating. Everybody should grow their own food.
2110,,
2111,"Could be better. Comfortable, worry free financial situation is what most people want",stop letting them in...take care of our own first. They will not bail us out when we are tapped out from rescuing them.
2112,,
2113,,
2114,I am fine but could be better.,I feel great. It's an opportunity for those who cannot live in their country for various reasons.
2115,,
2116,,
2117,Secure,I think immigration is important to Canada
2118,Not the best but getting better.,It's a great way to bring new talent to the country and reunite families.
2119,retired but had to go back to work to make ends meet,should be controlled more
2120,my personal financial situation would improve under a PC government,"I'm in favour of filtered immigration, not allowing everyone in regardless of where they come from, e.g. refugees from the US…There is no such thing and should be stopped immediately 

! ! !"
2121,n/a,n/a
2122,,
2123,Fine,
2124,I am scared of the future and how I will survive as I get older,I agree on helping others in need. However the government also must remember the folks in need that are Canadian born.
2125,,
2126,"Could be better, could be worse.","Since I'm an immigrant myself, I'd have to be pretty damned dense to have a negative opinion on it."
2127,I retired on a disability pension in 1992 and my income goes down each year. My husband retired and gets less than $400 from CP. We are living but not advancing.,Immigration is good. It's when they come in as refugees are given so much.
2128,It's good for now but we're hard workers and save for our retirement without expecting handouts from the government,I feel as if we should be taking care of our own first.
2129,The immigration process is a complete embarrassment to an otherwise great country. It has made living here (as an immigrant) very difficult.,"Although the system is broken, immigration is important to not only the economy but also to cultural awareness."
2130,none,none
2131,Terrible,Immigration is great for the Canadian economy. Almost all the jobs that immigrants take most Canadians do you not want. However their education should be recognized in Canada.
2132,,
2133,Cost of living is high and I literally live paycheck to paycheck just to stay afloat,Not a fan of it
2134,Satisfied...no problem,Helps our economy
2135,"With minimum wage going up, and my wages staying the same, it's overwhelming",I think we need to be very careful with immigration
2136,Satisfied,It should be monitored very carefully
2137,So unpredictable,Very pleasant
2138,,
2139,,
2140,Stressed,Fine
2141,"It sucks, all income goes to bills, mortgage and daycare",Unsure
2142,My financial situation right now is getting a bit better.,They doing the right law which is good for Canadian citizens.
2143,Not great about $450 short every month.,"Good for Canada but some of them are being offered cash job taking away Canadian citizen. This so they don't have to pay minimum wage of $14. 

Immigrants are being paid $2-less than $10 for blue collar jobs with no rights then threats to send back to their country."
2144,sad,"Sucks. Eventually in time white people will be extinct. There will be no more. It will be all mixed raced and everyone fighting everyone, will be a war in Canada and I will be the one over here saying I told you so. When will people learn to STOP messing with our values, morals, traditions, nation anthem and worrying about what everyone else might get upset over, I'm tired of living in a country where everyone else is above us Canadians and get a better chance at our life than our own, I'm embarrassed to be an Ontarian at the fact that we kill innocent dogs bases on a breed, which is breed racist to animals but do you care about that? Its time Ontario looked and re evaluated the Pitt bull ban, the statistics show that the attacks have risen and are we Canadians/Ontarian really dog murders?"
2145,It leaves a lot to be desired.,Canada is doing a good job.
2146,Eking by.,"As long as we can maintain our stance on multiculturalism, it will be fine."
2147,It sucks,
2148,We do not go without but we do not have a great deal of savings,I encourage policies to keep an eye on criminals but welcome immigrants and appreciate those willing to work at jobs that quite often Canadians don't want
2149,Recovering after major setback due to unemployment,"We must remain a haven for refugees, but not offer refugees more benefits than the average Canadian taxpayer"
2150,"I feel pretty good, would like to have more money to feel secure",I feel great about immigration.
2151,,"I think immigration is a benefit to Canada. However, people should enter Canada legally, through the immigration system. Not just cross the border without proper process and checks. It isn't fair to Canadian tax payers and it isn't fair to those waiting to immigrate to Canada who are following the process."
2152,Desperate,Slow
2153,Living paycheque to paycheque,
2154,,
2155,I get by,Tighten up a little
2156,,
2157,,
2158,tight,
2159,,
2160,troubled,take care of our own before the others
2161,It's a struggle to survive if you aren't wealthy,"We need to help others always, but we also need to help ourselves first to be in a position to help others. Why are so many Canadians struggling to live but we set up others to live better?"
2162,I'm doing okay. I live fairly well and can afford a vacation each year.,We should continue to allow people in but they should be screened
2163,Nope,It is useful and good
2164,"I am ok, but I worry about others","it is a good, necessary thing"
2165,,
2166,Good for the moment,Should be stop
2167,,
2168,"Rent nowadays is completely over the top expensive. Low income families can't afford it. Paying extra for hydro doesn't help, especially with the fee to get it to your residence. Rent & hydro needs to be cut in half.",IT SHOULD STOP!!! BORN HERE CANADIANS ARE GETTING SHIT ON LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER. WE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO LIVE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY BECAUSE THESE NEW FUCKERS GET EVERYTHING FOR FREE!!
2169,,
2170,scared,it's nice to be welcoming but we've gone way overboard
2171,I am a single mom and just getting by,I love that Canada embraces the many cultures around the world and provides a safe place for them to live while screening them to the max.
2172,"It's tough. We've had to go to one income because I had a baby and cannot afford day care and even if we could, there is no where available. So our debts are based on a two income household yet we can only bring in one income. Super hard and it can only get worse",
2173,,
2174,Ok,Immigrants should not complain but appreciate they are here
2175,I feel stuck. Only have enough to pay the bills,Immigration in Canada is fair. Opportunities for all
2176,Hopeless,Bringing new workers to Canada helps everyone. I love the diversity in Canada's work force and culture
2177,,
2178,Lucky I have a good job. Comfortable,Makes Canada a more rounded country
2179,comfortable,it is unnecessary - give the support to Canadians
2180,,
2181,I am disabled due to a stroke and currently receive ODSP which barely carries me through month to month.,"As long as the immigrant and his/her family contribute to the Canadian economy in a positive way I am more than welcoming.  I know that some people arrive in Canada and end up on government aid/welfare, but truly, how do you screen beforehand?"
2182,Getting pretty bad,Need better screening
2183,I am happy with my situation,We need it to keep our economy going.
2184,,
2185,I feel like I will never get ahead,"Feel like immigration is ok, but I don't think Canadian government should fund it."
2186,Could be better,"Keep the criminals out. 

Deport them"
2187,,
2188,,
2189,terrible,unsure
2190,STABLE,IT IS A POSITIVE THING
2191,Wish it was better,Too many are being brought in
2192,It's manageable,Good
2193,none,none
2194,"It is good - I am able to live comfortably, take vacations and save for retirement.","I am fine with it, as long as it doesn't take jobs away from Canadians."
2195,no comment,"I support immigration to Canada, however the government needs to also place more emphasis helping families already in the country."
2196,,
2197,scared. Never knowing what's going to happen next.,be more observant
2198,Comfortably ok,"Happy, hopefully those who come to Canada will use it to advance themselves and their families, which will promote our economy as a whole."
2199,I feel ok,"It is well managed, the laws are well done and diversity is awesome"
2200,not good,
2201,It could be better if we get paid for fairly.,"Overall, it has its strengths and drawbacks equally."
2202,,
2203,Very good because I work for the federal government. Glad I do not work for the provincial government.,I believe immigration is good for Canada however needs to have strict restrictions.
2204,Not satisfied due to higher taxes and insurance rates,I feel they have more rights and privileges than Canadians
2205,horrible,nothing
2206,Being retired I am comfortable with my savings and pension,I feel they are not vetted properly. I feel they do not make the effort to fit into the community and expect Canadians to accept them the way they are. They feel their religious beliefs take precedent over assimilating with their neighbours
2207,hopeless,no feeling
2208,Could be better,No comment
2209,Minimum wage went up and so did the cost of everything. Hydro is horrible,I have nothing against foreigners but they are trying to change out country. If they cant deal with us and our way of life go back to where you came from
2210,okay but should be earning better,"immigrants are not taking away jobs, people coming on visas are taking jobs away. we need to stop caring about hurting peoples feelings and have criminals that are not Canadian citizens deported. not invite past ISIS members on trips with Trudeau and still pay them"
2211,,
2212,meh,idk
2213,"living comfortably only because I live at home with parents and don't pay for housing, utilities, or phone. If I lived independently I'd be struggling",It's good thing for the economy and no human is illegal
2214,,
2215,,
2216,,
2217,Stressed,It's fair
2218,"I'm managing in a part time minimum wage job for now, but it can't support me forever.","I'm all for immigration for good people in moderation (i.e. not accepting more immigrants than our services, housing can support)"
2219,,
2220,,
2221,doing ok but dislike gas prices,limit the amount coming in and don't let them take over our ways
2222,it has gotten better since the minimum wage has gone up but it is still a struggle financially,no comment
2223,,
2224,,
2225,,
2226,Low income,It helps a lot
2227,Good.,I agree with the current policy and believe in the importance of immigration.
2228,"I'll never feel rich, but on the other hand I will never be poor. I have to plan ahead for big purchases, then I can make them.","I feel that we should regulate it more, and not be in such a hurry to take in the numbers that we do."
2229,I live paycheck to paycheck.  If it wasn't for food banks I would not be able to eat.,I am ok with it
2230,I am disabled and living on federal disability which provides less income than provincial disability without benefits. I sometimes go without my medications simply because I can't afford them. That creates further health issues. A national or provincial pharma care program is the answer as is ensuring that nobody lives so far beneath the poverty line that they can't afford basic necessities.,"Immigration benefits us all. There is beauty in diversity and immigrants who are educated are helping with doctor, nurse and skilled trade shortages!"
2231,Comfortable but need to be careful,We can afford to allow immigrants the same social benefits that long-term Canadians have been paying for their whole life
2232,,
2233,,
2234,scared,too high
2235,"I was forced out of my job by the WS&IB at the age of 45. I was then cut off of all my income and my WS&IB claim for 5 years. I had to sell everything of value I had, just to survive. I was then put on such a small pension I couldn't afford to live alone. I found a friend in the same position as I was and living together, like it or not, we can just get by. As an injured worker I shouldn't be forced into an arms length relationship I didn't want, just to be able to live modestly. WS&IB should not have the power to say if I work or not, I just missed a huge promotion because of the board!",We seem to have an open door policy under Trudeau. We are letting in far too many people who have no intention of becoming Canadian! Only those who know the language and will live throughout Canada as a Canadian should be allowed in the country and those that refuse should never be allowed to have a Canadian passport nor should they be able to own property in Canada.
2236,We are getting by but must remain frugal with everything we consider purchasing.,This country was made on immigrants. My family immigrated from Europe in the 50's. However things have changed and I don't think that people immigrating now are being assessed properly regarding their background history. More has to be done to thoroughly check into each and everyone wanting to become a true Canadian.
2237,should have started investing at a much younger age,"no problem with immigration, however they do take money out of health care services for Ontario residents"
2238,"I am ok with it right now, I make good money.",I feel that we can do a better job with screening immigrants and I think it's not helping our economy
2239,I feel I am on track for a comfortable retirement.,I feel we should take care of our own people before we start dishing out money to people from other countries.
2240,Terrified. We are retired and living on pension with no savings.,Immigration should be lessened as there are not enough jobs for Canadians
2241,ok,really don't know
2242,"We can pay for what we have, but I would like more.  Also if something happens (illness, injury) we would be in trouble",People who want to come to Canada for whatever reason generally have positive impact
2243,horrible,poor
2244,Struggling as a senior to meet financial obligations to stay in my home.,Should be more investigation into immigrants allowed into Canada to make sure they will be contributing members of our society and that they are not dangerous.
2245,Stinks,Make sure immigrants have gone through proper investigation to weed out the people who do not like our political situation and want to replace it with their religious values.
2246,It is okay but I wish the economy would be better. We need to stop supporting welfare and get people to work.,"They are willing to work jobs that Canadians feel are below them. If they are true immigrants I welcome them but not at everyone's expense, be fair to them but we have many living in poverty in our country as well."
2247,We are struggling because of the outrageous cost of daycare!,"Immigration and crime has increased since Justin Trudeau came into office. Opening the borders to immigrants has posed a great risk on Canada's safety and has made our wait times to see a doctor much  longer, burdened our welfare system and put great risk financially to future generations."
2248,,
2249,Worried about future. Will have to sell my home.,I agree with bringing refugees in due to conflicts in their country.
2250,struggling,scary
2251,,
2252,,
2253,doing good,"don't let them just walk into and get benefits medical, housing, attorneys + anything else they say they require."
2254,"I could be better but the constant increasing in taxes, food, gas and general services plus the increasing cost of home maintenance is taking its toll. It is time to get the governments both provincial and federal to get their heads out of their asses and start looking after the people who made this country what it is today. Stop being bullying around by special interest groups and do gooders.",If you cannot look after yourself you should not try to look after others. Immigration is a good thing for Canada but I am concerned that we are going way overboard and trying to take on more than we can handle. Opening the flood gates will backfire one way or another!!!
2255,okay,none
2256,,
2257,poor due to very little increase in pension,it is a good thing as long they apply through the proper channels
2258,,
2259,I am comfortable with current situation,Immigration is net-positive for Canada
2260,,
2261,Struggling to make ends meet,They are taking the jobs of Canadians
2262,,
2263,economic numbers presented every month are not an accurate picture of the health of the economy. Stock market volatility is indicative of day trading and not a good predictor or accurate reflection of the true economy.,"Should be rigorous screening for real versus fraudulent immigrants claiming status as Canadians. Health, language, and education achievement should be priority for those looking for Canadian status. They must learn English."
2264,"I am comfortable with my current financial situation because I created my own savings plan. If taxes increase, I would have to reassess my situation.",It is necessary for Canada to remain competitive and innovative on the international scene.
2265,IT COULD BE BETTER.,IT'S A GOOD THING IF IT'S WELL MONITORED & CASES ARE PROCESSED RAPIDLY. WAITING 2 OR 3 YEARS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE
2266,I am hanging on,we should keep tight polices on them
2267,,
2268,,
2269,It would be nice not to have to penny pinch,Being an immigrant myself in 1957 we made it on our own! Without government assistance.
2270,,
2271,"I had to retire earlier than expected. I planned to work until age 67 so all my debts were paid, but health would not allow, so I'm still paying debts with very constrained income.","Canada as a nation was formed through immigration. The Indigenous people were here, but others coming made a sea to sea to sea country. Immigrants bring new talents and beliefs."
2272,Being on ODSP and only being able to work part time I find it difficult to enjoy just the basics in life without getting behind on the bills.,If it is truly needed I think Canada should do the best they can to help.
2273,"husband wants to retire, but how much money are we going to need in the future with the cost of basics rising all the time.","we need them to maintain our population, but think SOME need to adapt to Canadian ways instead of the other way around."
2274,Month to month,Is ok but the amount of help they get is too much compared to elderly and disable .
2275,Check to check,"Positive, if vetted properly"
2276,sick,ok
2277,"not in a panic at the moment, but could be at any time",Welcome!
2278,,
2279,it is good,
2280,"getting by, but paying off debt.
 There should be breaks (tax, etc.) for single income earners","it should have been stopped years ago, from countries with criminals/bad people like Jamaica/Islam/Muslim"
2281,stressed,"getting out of control, let's mange and take care of our people first before we try to take on more mouths to feed"
2282,"Crap, as single people like myself don't get much from welfare. $300 to live off for a month is very  hard",Canada has helped many countries over the years and its about time we started looking after our own people
2283,"I need more money, lol!",We are all immigrants - get over it!!
2284,Quality,Quality
2285,"It's alright. Just retired, so concerned about drop in income",Concerned more about xenophobia than challenges created by allowing in immigrants.
2286,,
2287,"Well, comfortable and only getting better","Good, really helpful to help everyone"
2288,I have worked hard for what I have and with the cost of hydro and heating...it could cost me everything trying to keep up with their bills and pay all other expenses.,"I support immigration if it is done legally. Theses asylum seekers are illegal and taking away from those who have applied legally.  It seems the only people allowed in to Canada are terrorist, Muslim and illegal"
2289,It has been affected by political unrest both federally and by the province,"I feel these people coming across the border should be placed in areas that need work and not everyone to Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver"
2290,We are surviving,We need to look at all country when looking at immigration and not focus on only a few countries such as India. It takes a lot of immigrant many years if they are allowed to come to Canada where as other country it is very easy because our country thinks it will forge a bond with these countries. Everyone deserve a chance.
2291,Not great. If prices keep escalating the way they are now I will be in trouble paying rent.,"They are welcome, but should become Canadians, act, dress like a Canadian."
2292,Not good we struggle month to month,
2293,It is okay,I think it is a good thing
2294,,
2295,no,nothing wrong with immigration
2296,It's not where I'd like it to be,"I don't think we need to have the high numbers, especially for engineers, doctors, scientists - our own children are having difficulty finding jobs in these fields"
2297,Is better but must continue to improve.,The border problem needs to be solved.
2298,,
2299,"I have been on long-term disability since 1986.  While I am grateful for that income, I have never had enough money to save.  I live from deposit to deposit.  Since moving to Toronto, I have found everything, from rent to personal needs to foods, unreasonably expensive.  I despair at what I will do when I turn 65 and will be reliant only on government pensions.","To a degree, I have mixed feelings.  While I approve of immigration to Canada, I do feel the immigrants need to adapt to Canada's ways of life to some degree.  It is not my job to accept their standards of living and behaviour but theirs to accept those of their new home."
2300,It has not changed greatly over the last year.,
2301,I feel ok,Immigration in Canada is ok.
2302,It could be better.,I think it's time to help the people born in this country as much as they help immigrants.
2303,I'm scraping by but I'm not saving anything and I'm getting more and more worried that I will never be able to retire.,I think immigration is very good for Canada but we do need to screen people carefully to block terrorists or criminals.
2304,"Give me back my ODSP, I hate poverty wage everything went up not welfare.",Welcome and thanks for helping Canada strong.
2305,,
2306,,
2307,"Can NOT keep up with inflation and rising cost of food, insurance, taxes and heat & hydro","Backgrounds are not being checked properly, allowing too many non-working, unskilled immigrants to live off of the Canadian system.  Therefore, the working people end up paying for them."
2308,Being on Odsp has been a struggle,I think we should take care of our own first
2309,Good,Necessary but needs more controls
2310,,
2311,,
2312,,
2313,"Coping, but doing without vision and dental care unless emergency. No travel, no indulgences. Pay rent, buy groceries and pay utilities. Nothing more.",We need more.
2314,,I feel good about immigration. The doors should not be wide open. We should keep track of how many people are allowed to enter Canada
2315,,
2316,holding my own but not much left over to save or take a vacation,should be tightened up - set maximum targets each year
2317,"I am living on a fixed income. As prices go up, including my rent, my income does not, at least not enough to make much of a difference in my life.","Immigration is vital to our country. Unless one is Indigenous, we are all immigrants.  My grandparents came over from Eastern Europe. How can I disapprove of immigration?"
2318,,
2319,"Precarious, disappointed, never recover",The current policies are treasonous and anyone that continues this path the wrong should be imprisoned
2320,I am stable,Important to maintain and monitor
2321,Most of our take home income goes towards our housing situation. A big part goes to utilities.,I'm in favour of helping people who are in need. Canada should welcome immigrants with open arms when they with good intentions.
2322,,
2323,My situation is good because I saved from a early age for my retirement. I also have a company pension which helps,"We should not let these people from the United States come across the border and are allowed to stay, they are not coming from a country that needs help."
2324,Seniors need more assistance especially with health and care,That we need to help immigrants
2325,as long as taxes don't take we should be OK,legal immigration is the best way to go
2326,I am doing fine right now but do expect it will be a little tighter in a few years when I completely retire...hopefully I can put some money away to help...but what will be...will be,it will only help the country prosper and grow immigrants or natural Canadians all add to the betterment of Canada as a whole
2327,Not bad I have a good investor.,Only bring people that are skilled for a job that is open. But first make sure that a Canadian can't fill the position.
2328,ok,most of us are immigrants and have built Canada.
2329,Coping. Better off than most but that doesn't mean our bills can go through the roof and low income people get credits on their bills.,"If it is done properly, fine. I am an landed immigrant from USA.  I have been a permanent resident for 35 years.  As long as it is done through the proper channels it is ok.  Never mind illegally crossing borders."
2330,Comfortable with what I make,
2331,need more money,sometimes a necessity 
2332,Living on a fix income in Ontario is getting impossible with the cost of everyday essentials rising,Don't mind them at all but they should not demand so many special privileges and assimilate more.
2333,"doing ok, but if prices rise, like hydro, taxes, gasoline, I might be having a hard time of it financially.","I know we have to let some in as we aren't having enough children, but they give them too much!!  They should be giving more to our seniors, especially veterans.  Make long-time welfare recipients work for their money!"
2334,Very scared!,We need to look after our own before we start looking after others! Period!
2335,,
2336,I am somewhat comfortable with my financial situation but would be nice to be able to get the things I want now and then,I think a couple thousand a year should be able to immigrate to Canada...but they all have to be screened to be sure they are the best people to be able to enter Canada
2337,It's fine because we planned ahead!,If we have room and job opportunities I have no problem. However care for our own people first.
2338,Overall screwed,Too many non residents time to stop
2339,Could be better but not the worst,"I believe that most immigrants come to Canada striving for a better life and are therefore determined to work hard, which ultimately benefits the country"
2340,"As a student, not excellent.",Good. It helps the economy and adds diversity to the country
2341,living cheque to cheque,out of control
2342,,A good thing and should be kept.
2343,,
2344,"struggling to get ahead, still working as a necessity at the age of 68 and not expecting to retire until I am at least 71","please send your skilled, educated. Canada should make it easier for the skilled and educated to obtain the required licenses to practice their skills here"
2345,Holding my own,We all are either immigrants or descend from them. Even native people came here from somewhere else
2346,it's stable at this time,I think Canada is the best option for immigrants who are willing to contribute
2347,Fine. Living on a student budget.,"The practice itself is good. But we are taking in too many too quickly and spending too much money supporting them. I want the government to be able to help others, but it should be taking care of Canadians first. There are still many homeless Canadians, and many that are not able to afford food to feed their families. This, in addition to impoverished First Nations reserves, are issues that need to be dealt with first."
2348,Sad,Too many
2349,"Meh, could be better - could be worse",I'm for it
2350,Things are tight,Immigration is natural and everyone should welcome it
2351,,
2352,It's getting worse. Besides the raise all things are expensive,It's getting worse. So many people are coming & that is effecting economy badly
2353,,
2354,,
2355,needs improvement,unnecessary
2356,getting better,Great. Give other people opportunities for a better life.
2357,Has gotten worse. Significant other lost job. No benefits. Denied personal benefits because of being diabetic.,Mostly positive. Immigration is great but they must have a job or create work. Not just free money and housing.
2358,Very good,Good
2359,Ok,Ok helps the country
2360,It is okay but could be better,I think if they are willing to go through proper channels an be productive members of society they should be welcome. Those here illegally or who are living off of the government should not.
2361,"Just bought a new home, due to rise in prices in home it's expensive","I think so far they've done a good job, but I  do worry sometimes we are to open without doing proper screen checks"
2362,,
2363,Cost of living is expensive. Both my wife and I have jobs. We live in a decent condo but barely scrape by while managing debt etc. Could be a lot better. But not many would say different.,"My parents immigrated here a while ago (1970s). I was born here. I would prefer if we focused more on our citizens right now with things as bad as they are before letting even more people in. 



Living in Toronto is crowded enough as is."
2364,"Dire, to the point of losing everything unless there is a major turn of events.",There needs to be more regulation and less immigration until Canada can help out their own.
2365,"Wife great, I'm struggling",Positive - most of country comes from elsewhere
2366,Good,
2367,"was worse last year, but is getting better",Too many are coming into the country too fast
2368,,
2369,Confident I can pay for what I need.,It is complicated.
2370,I feel very good about my financial situation not because of any level of government but because of the serious investing I have done since I was 17. I have far more than I will need to live as comfortably as I want and do whatever I want.,"I feel we have far too many issues with homelessness and people who were born here that we need to fix before we start bringing immigrants in. In my building there are many immigrants and they have family members coming over to ""visit"", but they never leave as they are supposed to.*Adults living in a 1 bedroom apartment is nasty by way of dirty and overcrowded."
2371,Struggling to make ends meet,We are a nation of immigrants; we should welcome them
2372,"I am just getting by on one income, my husband stays home with my son",As long as they can afford it but not be a strain on the government
2373,I am sick of living pay cheque to pay cheque,There is always room for improvement. People wanting to immigrate to Canada who have family here should be given higher consideration
2374,Doomed,Immigrants are receiving too much government funding. They're taking jobs from Canadians. They should not receive free healthcare.
2375,very bad. I am unable to find a job according to my skills and qualification,it's good but achieving your goals is very difficult here
2376,,
2377,"getting worse all the time, we're being taxed out of existence",why come to Canada if you want to recreate what you claim to be trying to escape? Come to Canada to escape tyranny not to establish it!
2378,I wish there was more tax breaks for single mothers who work and have children,Enough already
2379,"I feel it sucks and there's no way for me to improve it. I'm on disability and cannot work for the foreseeable future. Cannot own or rent my own place, can't buy necessities most of the time.",I think it's part of our cultural diversity and a big plus about living here
2380,,
2381,I'm just able to make bills and have a little left over for savings.,no feelings one way or the other.
2382,,
2383,Good situation and getting better,Canada needs the immigration
2384,Currently adequate for now.,Should be limited so that Canadians don't lose their jobs.
2385,"I feel like I am under paid for the position I am in, I can make my bills and rent but savings and such take a back seat",They enhance and often times create jobs by opening local mom and pop stores and franchises
2386,we make ends meet but there is not much left over,
2387,Could be better,It is our human duty
2388,Doing ok,Need to reduce immigration.  All immigrants must speak English.
2389,Worse,
2390,,
2391,Glad I turned 18 and am able to receive minimum wage instead of student wage for the same job and responsibilities.,I think that's what makes our country so great because everyone here is an immigrant other than native Canadians. It is good to focus on humanity as a whole instead of our bordered in country and help people who are not as fortunate and/or are in danger.
2392,Has dropped and caused major debt,"As a child of immigrants, I am thankful that majority of immigrants are kind and helpful and that we are not just letting in ""criminals"""
2393,Could be managing better.,Newcomers create a more diverse country.
2394,No,Canada should continue to offer help
2395,,
2396,,
2397,gotten better,right decision
2398,,
2399,I feel okay about it.,"I don't think we should be taking them all in, there should be a better process so we don't let criminals, or rapists, or murderers in our country"
2400,Alright,It's a bit much at times
2401,we are comfortable,it can be a positive thing
2402,,
2403,Part time,Fine
2404,,
2405,,
2406,stressed,Too much too fast
2407,"After I pay my rent & utility bills I really don't have enough to survive properly on. I depend on the food bank, the Salvation Army & family to help me out with goods for myself. There are NO EXTRAS for me.","Believe immigrants can & do make a positive impact/influence in Canada. There are many countries that are extremely poor, are unsafe, at war, etc..  we have/need to take these immigrants in, particularly as everyone should have a safe home & individual freedoms.."
2408,,
2409,,
2410,We're comfortable,"Smart immigration allowing qualified, educated professionals, young families is good for the country. Taking in unskilled refugees in big numbers is a mistake as it drains resources (health, housing, child benefits) without adding value to the economy and social enrichment of the country"
2411,too much student debt,
2412,I'm a struggling student,Love it. The more diverse the better
2413,,
2414,not sure,not sure
2415,Could be better,We need to help
2416,,
2417,hopeless - no likeliness of work as I am too old (55) and unilingual (English),wish it were fair but we need to protect our social systems from those who will abuse it
2418,,
2419,I get by but don't have money left for extras.,It is a good idea. We need to save these people from the hardships in their war torn countries.
2420,very bad,"think there is too much of it, the immigrants get more help with everyday needs and money that Canadians fight to live for. This is our country but where is the help we need?"
2421,Difficult,
2422,I work paycheque to paycheque,I think it is a good thing but at some point we should make sure people already here are taken care of before we bring more people into our country
2423,,
2424,Student working so fine I'm coping with it,Nothing wrong with immigration
2425,Not the best,Good
2426,need more,refugees situation is too much.
2427,hopeful,good but we see less of the original people
2428,Barely surviving from paycheck to paycheck,Great diverse country
2429,I'm as broke as a convict.,"We had to lower our standards before people from poor countries could get into Canada. We should raise them back up. No access to social services until they've been here for five years. If they want to sponsor elderly relatives, they should be made to pay all expenses for them, including ALL health care. Look to Australia for an example."
2430,getting by,"make sure they get what they need, but not take away from Canadians that are here first"
2431,Stressed,Neutral
2432,We manage with what we have.  We are not big spenders and that helps when the government is trying to suck every last cent out of your pockets.,We are a county made of immigrants. Immigration is necessary to continue to grow our population.  We need stricter laws as to who we welcome and we need to stop bending over backwards to change our ways to suit newcomers.  Canada is a great place to live so if people want to live here they need to abide by our laws.
2433,comfortable,I feel the benefits of it far outweigh the few bad anecdotal examples
2434,Fixed income,Don't like it.
2435,,
2436,,
2437,great effort,great effort
2438,More money would be nice. Everything is so expensive these days how are we supposed to survive,Great why not help those who need it. Everyone deserves the chance to live in this great nation
2439,I feel fine about my financial situation and can mange it day to day,I have many friends and acquaintances who are immigrants.
2440,"I will have nothing for retirement 

I'm a struggling single mom","Like we are being pushed out of our own country

. Our way of life has had to accommodate them if they choose to come here they live like us."
2441,,
2442,"I feel like when I seem to get ahead and start earning what you have worked hard for, someone else with much less experience seems to be able to take my job for a dollar less. I would be fine if prices did not rise based on the new minimum wage.","It has gone too far, we have people born in Canada living in the streets and not able to support themselves. Give them the help first."
2443,"we can afford rent, food and car insurance but not much more.",
2444,I wish the money I'm putting towards retirement actually made some damn interest. I'd be better off squirreling the money away under my mattress.,Immigration is required as fewer and fewer of us born Canadians are opting to have children because our future outlook as a species is not good.
2445,Meh could be better,It is beautiful
2446,,
2447,,
2448,,
2449,Pissed off at the government,
2450,Wish it was better.,It's a positive thing and necessary for the growth and prosperity of this country.
2451,Stressed beyond words.,I believe that there are a lot of people in the world that need a place of refuge and Canada is one of the perfect places. Yes it can create less jobs for those we already have but we will adjust and do what we have to accommodate all
2452,,
2453,"Unstable, minimum wage increase made more damage. All prices went up including property taxes. I did not get a raise for 2 years, but have to pay more for everything.","I am an immigrant, and I started working as soon as I got my paperwork.  I believe government should help to immigrants / refugees in form of one time $1000-$3000 payments and no more help. ""Refugees "" know how the system works, sit on welfare, driving expensive vehicles and laughing. No welfare and unemployment for refugees and immigrants that do not want to work"
2454,,
2455,,
2456,Just getting by,It needs to be stopped until we can take care of the people here already
2457,It is not horrible but not great either. I'd say I'm somewhat satisfied with it as I know it could be a lot worse,"I think it has positives and negatives. There are good people who come here to better their lives, find jobs and contribute to society and there are people who come here to take advantage of the system."
2458,I'm drowning paycheque to paycheque,Equally we are a multicultural country
2459,sucks bigtime lol,"sucks ass … giving Syrian refugees 30,00 is just insane!!!"
2460,Not terrible but could be a lot better,Immigration is a great things as long as we have the resources to provide to immigrants and they come through legal channels
2461,,
2462,I am satisfied but it could be better.,Immigration could make the economy worse for those who are citizens.
2463,it's comfortable but not extravagant.,I'm an immigrant so I agree with some immigration but when my family moved here we didn't get any of the financial support the refugees are getting now. We earned our place here as Canadians.
2464,Pessimistic,Immigration is good for Canada's economy. They contribute to taxes and education and they create jobs and a demand for more services. If a contribution is made to the country they have just as much right to be Canadian as any one else.
2465,Alright,Great
2466,Pessimistic,Good for both sides
2467,"I struggle, pay check to pay check",I understand that we want to help but sometimes it seems too many are coming here
2468,,
2469,I feel secure with our finances right now,It was too much too fast recently and I don't believe people should be made citizens right away
2470,I feel okay,"It is good, this country is BUILT ON IMMIGRATION SO TO OPPOSE IT IS IDIOTIC"
2471,idk,no
2472,Struggling to get by.,Immigration is a positive thing for all.
2473,,
2474,I am ok very lucky,not ambivalent
2475,,
2476,,
2477,,
2478,could be better,gotten out of hand
2479,Ok so far,
2480,Pretty good,I love them
2481,,
2482,sad,
2483,Could be much better. Work in hospital and no salary increase in 6 years but taxes keep going up,
2484,Blah,
2485,,
2486,,"Immigration can be a good thing for a country and its economy.  There should be a comprehensive and balanced immigration policy that takes into consideration of what is good for Canada and its citizens (economy, etc.) and what works for immigrants wanting to come to Canada"
2487,Je paie plus cher les services d'hydro one et j'ai moins de service,L'immigration coûts très cher
2488,,
2489,we've worked hard to be comfortable,too many people coming with huge needs and many are here for long periods and still do not speak English or work
2490,"It's just ok to survive, but not we can afford own house.",There should be a transparent system. That won't cause trouble to genuine cases but filter out fake cases.
2491,Bad and getting worse,I have no comments on this
2492,stressful,idk
2493,,
2494,COMFORTABLE,I SUPPORT IT AS LONG AS PEOPLE FOLLOW THE RULES - I DON'T LIKE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
2495,I find it tough at times to get by,I think it's great in some ways
2496,Have fun,Don't know
2497,I live from paycheque to paycheque.,The population born here is not reproducing fast enough or at all to replace the population dying. Immigration is necessary and should reflect all walks of life with no discrimination.
2498,I feel like I am still building. My partner and I are trying really hard to catch up with debts as well as put a little bit of money aside. It is sometimes difficult due to expenses that randomly come around,
2499,Not enough,No comment
2500,just enough to pay all the bills,stop the illegal immigrants. everyone should wait their turn to be fair
2501,"good, debt free",if they are not criminals I'm fine with it
2502,Stressed,I hate it. It is a waste of tax dollars when they get everything.
2503,"Decent. Not great, not horrible.","Decent. Not amazing, not terrible."
2504,,
2505,Have enough to live. But there is no money to save. Find it hard to save money when there's very little left after the all is paid for.,Alright
2506,Good,Good
2507,hi,ff
2508,worst it's ever been,close the doors
2509,,
2510,My financial situation is ok. Not good enough to lose baby bonus like I did,We should take care of Canadians before helping foreigners
2511,"I feel good, but that it could be better",Immigration to Canada is good
2512,It is OK,Keep better control of it
2513,get enough to get by,"we let too many unskilled people in, they are not vetted as much as they should be"
2514,I can no longer generate a profit from my saving because of government and third party manipulations of free trade.,If the population cannot generate profitable labour yes immigration is needed but there is still much unused labor in the country that is ignored due to biases of our business leaders.
2515,"I am poor at $24,500 p.a.",
2516,,
2517,Satisfied for the present but worried about the future,Immigration benefited Canada in the past and it will in the future especially as our population ages.
2518,"It's good, but while my financial situation has improved, I don't think it's kept up with the growth in Ontario's economy.","It's positive! Immigration is a positive driver of growth in the economy, and increases the market for goods and products."
2519,It's worst I need help,I am a immigrant and I don't find it helpful
2520,,
2521,Getting by but we are lower middle income and still find it hard to make ends meet.,My wife is an immigrant so I'm all for it.
2522,comfortable but sensitive to inflation,"too many exceptions, no accountability"
2523,Doing okay - could be better.,Immigration is critical for our economic future.
2524,wish it was better,sketchy
2525,No difference,Everyone was an immigrant at some point only the original natives were here before the criminal Columbus showed up
2526,,
2527,ok,s
2528,"great, debt free",great
2529,It's getting better as I get a raise each year,Many provinces desperately need immigrants
2530,Barely scraping by.,The question should be asked of them if they will assimilate with the Canadian way of life and not maintain customs to the detriment of the general population.
2531,"it's ok, I get by",not sure
2532,"It's currently stable, but the recent increases in food and gas prices are starting to make a dent and the proposed carbon tax by Justin TruDUMB will make the dent even worse.","The situation is upside down. Instead of prioritizing the immigration of minorities persecuted in Muslim majority countries, the Canadian government floods us with the persecutors along with their hatred and intolerance."
2533,Bad and getting worse,Unwelcome and create a lot of social issues
2534,,
2535,???????,????????
2536,Trying to make ends meet all the time. Government does not help the situation. Every time you think things MIGHT get better things go in reverse. I hate it,"I always say feed your people, educate your people, help the poor and sick in your country before letting immigrants in ."
2537,,
2538,It's tough to pay all expenses because housing costs are too high,Increase the number and continue higher quality
2539,I think it is just getting by,I think it is ok but I think if they want to live here they need to be the way we are and not try to change use to make them feel like home. Mostly religion. If I moved to their country I would not try to change them
2540,Not very good.,"It's 2018, people are people."
2541,Help.,It's alright
2542,,
2543,I'm just starting to get a handle on retirement. Small steps.,"I agree that immigration should be increased. But, we should hold new citizens to a high standard and retain the right to send those who live by criminal means BACK to where they came from. Would 5 years be too much to expect? Gang violence and such should deserve a ""go directly home"" card."
2544,doing okay,
2545,,
2546,good,poor
2547,excellent,immigration is important to Canada economically
2548,As a pensioner I have to juggle my finances when buying non everyday requirements,only immigrants who are prepared to integrate and support their families should be admitted
2549,stable,beneficial
2550,It sucks,It's right
2551,,
